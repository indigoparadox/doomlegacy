:Name: Make DoomLegacy under Windows.

Tested using Win98.  Many procedures will be similar for the other versions of Windows.

** Win98 using MinGW
You will be editing the DoomLegacy Makefile as to where these were installed.

Install MinGW gcc compiler
  Target  c:\mingw\

Install SDL.
  Target  c:\SDL\

Install SDL-Mixer (separate download)
  Target c:\SDL\SDL-mixer
  Move SDL-mixer\include\* to SDL\include\SDL
  Move SDL-mixer\lib\*  to SDL\lib

Install DLL files in Windows\System32
  Copy or move
    SDL\lib\SDL.dll   to  \Windows\System32
   SDL\lib\ SDL_mixer.dll   to \Windows\System32

Edit doomlegacy\Makefile.
    Some defines need to be set in the Makefile, or passed on the make command line each time.
       WIN32=1
       CC_MINGW=1
       SMIF=SDL
       HAVE_MIXER=1
    MinGW is gcc
       CC=gcc
    Edit OPT and LIB lines in SDL section, as to where SDL include and lib reside if they are not as expected.

Invoke the make

If edited the Makefile with switches
   > mingw32-make

If using command line switches
   > mingw32-make  WIN32=1  CC_MINGW=1   SMIF=SDL   HAVE_MIXER=1

A batch file with the the above make command, put it one directory up
  > ..\make1

If error on SDL.h, or  SDL_stdinc, then check the Makefile lines about where the SDL include reside.
If error on alloca, you have a UNIX SDL, you need the one for Win32 (which has a different SDL_config).
If error about missing SDL_mixer then you forgot to put SDL_mixer.h in with the other SDL include files.

Make a runtime directory, and put into it
  The doomlegacy binary from bin.
  legacy.wad
  Any wads that you want to play.

DoomLegacy will now search some directories as possible doomwad and
home directories. These are set in doomdefs.h.  If they do not exist,
then it will use the current directory, but only if it is longer than a root
reference: "c:\".

These defines in doomdef.h need "\\" for each backslash because of
C-string backslash processing.
#define DEFWADS1  "\\doomwads"
#define DEFWADS2  "\\games\\doomwads"
#define DEFHOME   "\\legacyhome"

Put your wad files in directory "\doomwads", or "\games\doomwads", or
in the current directory.  DoomLegacy will use the first that exists
as the doomwaddir.

Suggest use home directory "c:\legacyhome".

Your home directory will get the savegames and saved config files.
Set the environment variable "HOME" in a batch file, or use the -home switch
when starting DoomLegacy, example: "doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsavegames".
Otherwise, if the default DEFHOME directory exists, "\legacyhome",
it will be used as HOME.

Recommend using directories under root, as windows directory names with
spaces could cause problems (depending on how they are specified).

Use the verbose switch -v, and DoomLegacy will print to stderr the directory
names that it used.  On Win98 this becomes a file named stderr.

Examples assume c:\doom\run is the doomlegacy runtime directory, but you
should put your actual directory name.  Replace any directory names
with your actual directory names.  Doomlegacy can handle very long
command lines, and you must put all switches on one line.

Example: Batch file for FreeDoom
Create file dl_freedoom.bat
  cd c:\doom\run
  doomlegacy -v -game freedoom

Example: Batch file for hth2.wad, using FreeDoom as default game:
Demonstrates using -home switch.
Create file dl_hth2.bat
  cd c:\doom\run
  doomlegacy -v -file hth2.wad -home c:\games\hth2_setup

Example: Batch file for some pwads, where doom2.wad is in "c:\doomwads":
Current directory is ignored by using DEFWADS1 and absolute path names.
Create file dl_some.bat
  c:\doom\run\doomlegacy -game doom2 -file c:\games\pwads\some.wad

Example: Batch file for pwad, deh, and bex modifications.
Directory c:\games\wads contains all the wad, deh, and bex files,
with c8 in subdirectory pw.
The order of files is important.  If, for example: c8.wad is a new level,
and mod3 adds new sounds, the mod3 sounds will override those
of the same name in c8.wad and doom2.wad.
Create file dl_ex2.bat
  cd c:\doom\run
  SET DOOMWADDIR=c:\games\wads
  SET HOME=c:\games\home
  doomlegacy -game doom2 -file pw\c8.wad mod1.wad mod2.deh mod3.bex

Example: Shortcut for DoomLegacy with plutonia wad:
Create shortcut dl_plut
  command: c:\doom\run\doomlegacy -v -game plutonia
  current directory: c:\doom\run

Example: Shortcut for DoomLegacy with plutonia2 wad:
Create shortcut dl_plut2
  command: c:\doom\run\doomlegacy -game plutonia -file c:\games\pl2\PL2.WAD
  current directory: c:\doom\run
