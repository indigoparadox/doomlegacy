patchfile = w35_texture_generate.patch
- committed revision 594   by wesley johnson
Fix segfault in phobiata.wad.  It has a texture of one patch, but that
patch is smaller than the texture.  The draw routine segfaults upon
trying to access texture columns that are not in the patch.
The new function will create in the patch cache a new patch of the dimensions
of the texture, using the patch columns.  All columns will exist.
Wad structures in the headers are changed to use stdint types, so they are
not dependent upon machine word size.
Comments are added to document discovered information.

reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

instead of vid.width and vid.height.
All callers of the low level draw routines now check their parameters
against the view window boundaries before calling.
Added some tests to intercept bad sprite ptrs caused by wads without all
the sprites present.
Comments are added to document discovered information.
Some names are changed to better reflect their intended usage, and
reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

patchfile = w37_multi_patch.patch
- committed revision 600   by wesley johnson
Added capability to combine patches (from a multi-patch texture) into
one patch, that has transparent regions.  This is needed for phobiata.wad

can now be seen through.
Added texture_model field to texture to replace using test on
numpatches to determine drawing routine.

*** w37_things_print

- committed revision 601   by wesley johnson
I_SoftError messages in things.c were missing a \n.

*** w38_enemy

patchfile = w41_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 623   by wesley johnson
Dehacked file pl2.deh (plutonia2) segfaults due to writing string over const.
String replacement changed to use Z_Strdup, and old string is abandoned,
as it could be a const.  There is no good test to recover allocated
strings, but dehacked does not encounter many of those, and executes only
once at load time.

patchfile = w41_draw_clip_b.patch
- committed revision 624   by wesley johnson
Phobiata.wad had a bright line on right edge of screen.

*** w41_sound
patchfile = w41_sound.patch
- committed revision 625   by wesley johnson

*** w43_modelsector
patchfile = w43_modelsector.patch
- committed revision 632   by wesley johnson
Clean up use of sector models for Boom deep water and Legacy water.
This changes uses of sector->heightsec to be a model sector reference,
and changes most tests against it to be against sector->model.
This excludes special colormap sectors from being treated as water
sectors and properly ignores their floor and ceiling levels.
Enforce protection against model sector=-1 at the time sector model is set,
thus removing many unnecessary tests and making code intent clear.
Change some repetitive array accesses to use ptrs, reducing code size.

- committed revision 638   by wesley johnson
Changes to the hardware renderer to fix some problems, and to clean it
up so other fixes are easier.

SPRITE_LIGHTLEVEL : convert sprite drawing to use same lightlevel
calculations that software renderer has been using.

TERM_TRANSFORM : generates precalculated combined transform terms that
reduces transforms per vertex to only 5 multiplies and 5 adds for
sprites, and 8 multiples and 8 adds for world.

DOOR_CLOSED_FIX : code from software renderer for closed doors. Not
enabled yet, needs checking.

Reduced lightlevel K-factor in LUT table from 2 to 1.2 to better match the
software renderer brightness.

Tests that rejects empty lines for trigger copied from software
renderer, as it has more conditions that seem important.

Code from r_bsp that determines the light levels of ceiling and floor,
taking into account multiple floors.

This code is much easier to read and understand, and is smaller.
Makes model floor and ceiling transitions more consistent.
Old code is retained for comparison until such time as correctness is clear.

Documents a bug that is not fixed.
When 2 players, with 2nd player not active, the second player will segfault

*** w52_skintable_translations
patchfile = w52_skintable.patch
- committed revision 666   by wesley johnson
Too many uses of the term trans, confusing translucent and skin
translation.
The skin tables are renamed from translationtables to skintranstables,
and dc_translation becomes dc_skintran.
Define SKIN_TO_SKINMAP, MT_TO_SKINMAP, to bring indexing calculations

patchfile = w52_hw_colormap.patch
- committed revision 672   by wesley johnson
Bug fix, hardware renderer can now display Boom colormaps, and can now
display levels of colormap brightness.
Create R_ColormapAnalyze, to generate hardware rgba info from Boom colormaps.
Enhance the extra_colormap rgba field to be an array, selected by lightlevel.
This gives the opengl colormaps some lightlevel effect.

patchfile = w52_hw_no_texture2.patch
- committed revision 676   by wesley johnson
More no-texture tests needed in FakeFloor rover code, with wider protection.

Added code to detect and intercept Doom graphics that were left in the
chexquest1 wad by the developers.
When player escapes the difficulty menu, it goes to the episode menu,

Added code to give Chex episode names, instead of Doom episode names,
or block the episode menu.

patchfile = w53_bossdeath.patch
- committed revision 681   by wesley johnson

- committed revision 696   by wesley johnson
Fix some math overflow for large maps like Europe.wad, where MAP01 is
enormous.
Change some short wad field types to uint16_t where needed, as those fields
could be overflowed and they do not need a sign.
Detect some buggy wad conditions and correct it as much as possible, 
or Error msg exit, at least prevent segfaults.
Detect bad linedef number, missing sidedefs, in P_LoadSegs.
Detect missing sidedefs, in P_LoadSubsectors.

Europe.wad will load and run after this patch, but has automap problems,
and some other bugs.
Rename the blockmap global vars to be less confusing, as blockmaphead
and blockmapindex (as neither is the lump).
