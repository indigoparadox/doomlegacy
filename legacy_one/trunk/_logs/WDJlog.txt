patchfile= w12_drawpatch.patch
- committed revision 554, 555,  by wesleyjohnson
Simplify the combination of DrawPatch and GetLump using PU_CACHE, by

of PU_CACHE into 3 DrawPatch functions.  This is in preparation for fixing
usage of PU_CACHE throughout the whole program.

*** w13_alloc_cache
patchfile= w13_alloc_cache.patch
- HOLDING
- Careful analysis of the PU_CACHE usage and fixing any usage where it

Rename of some rdraw variables to add the prefix rdraw_ to give them more unique names,

being used.

Make use of ENUM values for legacy flat modes, instead of int literals.
