*** w1_softerror
patchfile= w1_softerror.patch
- committed revision 544   by smite-meister
Adds a I_SoftError function, as an alternative to I_Error function
Softerror function prints message once, ignores messages already
printed, and returns to caller.
Changes some I_Error calls to I_SoftError

*** w2_doordelay
patchfile= w2_doordelay.patch
- committed revision 546    by smite-meister
Adds a Doordelay control variable and menu item
Alters the time that a door stays open.  Allows players to
succeed in overly difficult wads without resorting to noclip.

*** w3_gamma
patchfile= w3_gamma.patch
- merged with w25_gamma
Adds another, darker, gamma table.
See newer gamma generator.

*** w4_zalloc
patchfile= zalloc.patch,  zalloc_v2.patch
- merged with w22_zone
Two critical errors fixed in the Z_Malloc code.
See newer z_zone.c file, with more capability.

*** w5_heretic
patchfile= w5_heretic.patch

*** w7_flat
patchfile= w7_flat.patch
- committed revision 564   by smite-meister
Removes old change had flats searching the entire file, ignoring
F_START and F_END.  This failed for at least one wad, that had the same name
on a sprite.  Changed to honor F_START and F_END, and only when that fails,
then search entire file (so that gothic2.wad also works).

*** w8_voodoo
patchfile= w8_voodoo.patch
- committed revision 563    by smite-meister
Create voodoo dolls for extra player1 start positions.
This is necessary for many wads, which use the voodoo dolls for timers

*** w12_drawpatch
patchfile= w12_drawpatch.patch
- committed revision 554, 555,  by wesleyjohnson
Simplify the combination of DrawPatch and GetLump using PU_CACHE, by
creating a function that does both.  This brings most of the casual usage
of PU_CACHE into 3 DrawPatch functions.  This is in preparation for fixing
usage of PU_CACHE throughout the whole program.

*** w13_alloc_cache
patchfile= w13_alloc_cache.patch
- merged with w22_zone
- Careful analysis of the PU_CACHE usage and fixing any usage where it
crosses another call of Z_Malloc.

patchfile= w16_segabor.patch
- committed revision 571   by wesley johnson
Brings over the segabor patches from Legacy 143beta_macosx.

*** w17_rdraw
patchfile= w17_rdraw.patch
- committed revision 572   by wesley johnson
Rename of some rdraw variables to add the prefix rdraw_ to give them more unique names,
because they were named identical to some other variables in structs.  This makes it
much easier to grep or search for all uses, and to realize exactly which variable was
being used.

*** w18_SM
patchfile= w18_SM.patch
- committed revision 573   by wesley johnson
Make use of ENUM values for legacy flat modes, instead of int literals.

Third part of changed for endian conversion.
Covers hardware and other subdirectories that were missed in part 2.

*** w32_round
patchfile = w32_p3.patch
- committed revision 591   by wesley johnson
Gives alternative for round and roundf in video.  They are not standard library
and are C99 only.

*** w33_b_node
patchfile = w33_b_node2.patch
- committed revision 592   by wesley johnson
Adds a test for indexes out-of-bounds before accessing the b_node array.
This stops legacy from having a segfault for some wads with minor flaws,
like using a Boom linedef 244 instead of 242.
Also fixes some indenting and add some brackets to make readable.

*** w34_zone
patchfile = w34_zone.patch
- committed revision 593   by wesley johnson
Fix possible failing of Z_FreeTags when it combines free blocks.
Change size_t to uintptr_t, per stdint.h.
Mark free blocks with id.
Remove id and tag as PU_INVALID, blocks that are destroyed.
Create PU_PRIV_CACHE level, which does not get purged until 2nd pass of
trying to allocate in Z_Malloc.  These can be used for those cached
blocks that require considerable processing to create, like multi-patch
textures.

*** w35_texture_generate
patchfile = w35_texture_generate.patch
- committed revision 594   by wesley johnson
Fix segfault in phobiata.wad.  It has a texture of one patch, but that
patch is smaller than the texture.  The draw routine segfaults upon
trying to access texture columns that are not in the patch.
The new function will create in the patch cache a new patch of the dimensions
of the texture, using the patch columns.  All columns will exist.
Wad structures in the headers are changed to use stdint types, so they are
not dependent upon machine word size.
Comments are added to document discovered information.
Some names are changed to better reflect their intended usage, and
reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

*** w36_draw_clip
patchfile = w36_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 595   by wesley johnson
Fix segfaults due to low level draw using bad ylookup[].
The video column lookup table, ylookup[], is only as wide as the view window.
The low level draw routines RANGECHECK now checks against the view window
instead of vid.width and vid.height.
All callers of the low level draw routines now check their parameters
against the view window boundaries before calling.
Added some tests to intercept bad sprite ptrs caused by wads without all
the sprites present.
Comments are added to document discovered information.
Some names are changed to better reflect their intended usage, and
reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

*** w36b_draw_clip
patchfile = w36b_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 599   by wesley johnson
Move some {} and put \n on some I_SoftError.

*** w37_multi_patch_texture
patchfile = w37_multi_patch.patch
- committed revision 600   by wesley johnson
Added capability to combine patches (from a multi-patch texture) into
one patch, that has transparent regions.  This is needed for phobiata.wad
and makes a great difference in the appearance.  The gates and fences
can now be seen through.
Added texture_model field to texture to replace using test on
numpatches to determine drawing routine.

*** w37_things_print
patchfile = w37_things_print.patch
- committed revision 601   by wesley johnson
I_SoftError messages in things.c were missing a \n.

*** w38_enemy
patchfile = w38_enemy.patch
- committed revision    by wesley johnson
Fixed some test logic to include testing for valid ptr to target before
using the ptr.  This stops segfaults that happen in heavy fighting.
