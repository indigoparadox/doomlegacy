Adds a I_SoftError function, as an alternative to I_Error function
Softerror function prints message once, ignores messages already
printed, and returns to caller.
Changes some I_Error calls to I_SoftError

*** w2_doordelay
patchfile= w2_doordelay.patch
- committed revision 546    by smite-meister

patchfile= w12_drawpatch.patch
- committed revision 554, 555,  by wesleyjohnson
Simplify the combination of DrawPatch and GetLump using PU_CACHE, by
creating a function that does both.  This brings most of the casual usage
of PU_CACHE into 3 DrawPatch functions.  This is in preparation for fixing
usage of PU_CACHE throughout the whole program.

patchfile= w13_alloc_cache.patch
- merged with w22_zone
- Careful analysis of the PU_CACHE usage and fixing any usage where it

*** w17_rdraw
patchfile= w17_rdraw.patch
- committed revision 572   by wesley johnson
Rename of some rdraw variables to add the prefix rdraw_ to give them more unique names,
because they were named identical to some other variables in structs.  This makes it
much easier to grep or search for all uses, and to realize exactly which variable was
being used.

Covers hardware and other subdirectories that were missed in part 2.

*** w32_round
patchfile = w32_p3.patch
- committed revision 591   by wesley johnson
Gives alternative for round and roundf in video.  They are not standard library
and are C99 only.

*** w33_b_node
patchfile = w33_b_node2.patch
- committed revision 592   by wesley johnson
Adds a test for indexes out-of-bounds before accessing the b_node array.
This stops legacy from having a segfault for some wads with minor flaws,
like using a Boom linedef 244 instead of 242.
Also fixes some indenting and add some brackets to make readable.

Change size_t to uintptr_t, per stdint.h.
Mark free blocks with id.
Remove id and tag as PU_INVALID, blocks that are destroyed.
Create PU_PRIV_CACHE level, which does not get purged until 2nd pass of

textures.

*** w35_texture_generate
patchfile = w35_texture_generate.patch
- committed revision 594   by wesley johnson
Fix segfault in phobiata.wad.  It has a texture of one patch, but that
patch is smaller than the texture.  The draw routine segfaults upon
trying to access texture columns that are not in the patch.
The new function will create in the patch cache a new patch of the dimensions
of the texture, using the patch columns.  All columns will exist.
Wad structures in the headers are changed to use stdint types, so they are
not dependent upon machine word size.
Comments are added to document discovered information.
Some names are changed to better reflect their intended usage, and
reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

*** w36_draw_clip
patchfile = w36_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 595   by wesley johnson
Fix segfaults due to low level draw using bad ylookup[].
The video column lookup table, ylookup[], is only as wide as the view window.
The low level draw routines RANGECHECK now checks against the view window
instead of vid.width and vid.height.
All callers of the low level draw routines now check their parameters
against the view window boundaries before calling.
Added some tests to intercept bad sprite ptrs caused by wads without all
the sprites present.
Comments are added to document discovered information.
Some names are changed to better reflect their intended usage, and
reduce confusion with the same name in different usage.

*** w36b_draw_clip
patchfile = w36b_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 599   by wesley johnson
Move some {} and put \n on some I_SoftError.

*** w37_multi_patch_texture
patchfile = w37_multi_patch.patch
- committed revision 600   by wesley johnson
Added capability to combine patches (from a multi-patch texture) into
one patch, that has transparent regions.  This is needed for phobiata.wad
and makes a great difference in the appearance.  The gates and fences
can now be seen through.
Added texture_model field to texture to replace using test on
numpatches to determine drawing routine.

*** w37_things_print
patchfile = w37_things_print.patch
- committed revision 601   by wesley johnson
I_SoftError messages in things.c were missing a \n.

*** w38_enemy
patchfile = w38_enemy.patch
- committed revision 602   by wesley johnson
Fixed some test logic to include testing for valid ptr to target before
using the ptr.  This stops segfaults that happen in heavy fighting.

*** w37_compiler_msg
patchfile = w37_compiler_msg.patch
- committed revision 603   by wesley johnson
Fixed switch stmts to not give compiler message.  This was done before
in w37 but got lost before commit.

*** w39_overflow
patchfile = w39_overflow.patch

Preparation for savegame improvements.

*** w40_GDESC
patchfile = w40_GDESC.patch

without having to rename files.
Added wad_selection.txt documentation.
Removed game name string allocation that was lost memory.

*** w40_savegame

Savegame sync bytes are written and checked.
Provision for optional savegame sections.
Checks to not load savegames of different word length or endianess.

- committed revision 622   by wesley johnson
Revisit of w36_draw_clip.
Severe display artifacts observed on flats in Twilight.wad, but not in
other wads, which are fixed by this patch.
Remove a test on dc_x as it was skipping needed loop end operations.
Limit range of dc_x earlier, as calls to SegLoop can have x1..x2 range
exceed the screen.

*** w41_dehacked
patchfile = w41_draw_clip.patch
- committed revision 623   by wesley johnson
Dehacked file pl2.deh (plutonia2) segfaults due to writing string over const.
String replacement changed to use Z_Strdup, and old string is abandoned,
as it could be a const.  There is no good test to recover allocated
strings, but dehacked does not encounter many of those, and executes only
once at load time.

*** w41_draw_clip_b
patchfile = w41_draw_clip_b.patch
- committed revision 624   by wesley johnson
Phobiata.wad had a bright line on right edge of screen.
Test to limit rw_stopx changed from rdraw_viewwidth-1 to rdraw_viewwidth
because the loop range of dc_x is rw_x .. rw_stopx-1.

*** w41_sound
patchfile = w41_sound.patch
- committed revision 625   by wesley johnson
Adds conditional code that makes sound work for systems with old SDL
versions.   When detecting an old version of the SDL mixer include file,
code is inserted to write the midi file to a tmp file and load it
the old way.

*** w41_makefile
patchfile = w41_makefile.patch
- committed revision 626   by wesley johnson
Fixes dependencies so that they are recognized by MAKE.

Removes some old code.

*** w41_savegame_time
patchfile = w41_savegame_time.patch
- committed revision 628   by wesley johnson

Handles a NULL mobj pointer, instead of I_Error on it.

*** w41_savegame_dir
patchfile = w41_savegame_dir.patch
- committed revision 629   by wesley johnson
First cut at improving savegame menu system.
These are a work in progress, and are not finished.
Controled by defines  SAVEGAME99, SAVEGAMEDIR, as set in doomdef.h.
Adds ability to have 99 savegames.  Still cannot see more than 6.
Not all controls are finished.
Adds ability to have savegame directories.
This code works and is playable, but network game save will change in
future revision.

*** w42_message
patchfile = w42_message.patch
- committed revision 630   by wesley johnson
Simple message function.

*** w42_savegame
patchfile = w41_savegame_dir.patch
- committed revision 631   by wesley johnson
Cleaned up savegame menus.
Made legacy home string separately available.
Added directory and savegame delete.
Added directory and savegame scrolling.
Except for system dependent directory scanning, this finishes
the savegame revision.

*** w43_modelsector
patchfile = w43_modelsector.patch
- committed revision 632   by wesley johnson
Clean up use of sector models for Boom deep water and Legacy water.
This changes uses of sector->heightsec to be a model sector reference,
and changes most tests against it to be against sector->model.
This excludes special colormap sectors from being treated as water
sectors and properly ignores their floor and ceiling levels.
Enforce protection against model sector=-1 at the time sector model is set,
thus removing many unnecessary tests and making code intent clear.
Change some repetitive array accesses to use ptrs, reducing code size.

*** w44_byteswap
patchfile = w44_patchfile.patch
- committed revision 633   by wesley johnson
Finishes change from LE_SHORT, LE_LONG, to LE_SWAP16 and LE_SWAP32.
