*** OLDWATER removal
= rev 596, 597
OLDWATER was an attempt at implementing realistic water using negative
sector tag values (-tag == water height). It used values 888 and 887
in the player_t::specialsector field to denote negative tag- and floor
flat image -based water content, respectively. It also used
visplane_t::picnum value 1998 to denote a water plane.

Removed completely, as we now have better methods for creating water.


*** Added this log
= rev 598


*** Makefile cleanup
= rev 604
Replaced all the separate multimedia interface options by one option, IF,
which defaults to SDL. Removed unnecessary defines DIRECTFULLSCREEN, VID_X11.
Also: Removed some old unused endianness code, small bugfix in p_floor.c.


*** Fixing the savegame system
= rev 605, 606
Replaced the hack used for saving and loading mobj_t pointers, the new system
should be 64-bit safe. The savegame files are not yet platform-independent
since the memcpy-based saving system does not take care of endianness.
FS save/load should work also, including FS arrays.

Fixed handling of active plats, now stopped plats should stay stopped
when loading.


*** vsprintf fixes
= rev 608
Replaced a number of unsafe uses of vsprintf with vsnprintf, fixing
several console-related crashing bugs. There may be more of the same
in the interface code (SDL and OpenGL are clean).


*** The great compiler warning cleanup
= rev 609, 610
Fixed a LOT of compiler warnings. Now the 64-bit version compiles cleanly.
There were lots of questionable pointer hacks in the code, some of which still remain.
Also backported some stuff to tables.h and tables.c from Legacy2.


*** Small z_zone changes
= rev 635
ZONEID is now the first field in memblock_t so that it'll be the first
field to be corrupted by an overflow in the preceding block(s).
Replaced all if(block->user > 0x100) tests by if(block->user).
