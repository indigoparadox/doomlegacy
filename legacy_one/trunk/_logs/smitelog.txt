*** OLDWATER removal
- committed rev 596, 597
OLDWATER was an attempt at implementing realistic water using negative
sector tag values (-tag == water height). It used values 888 and 887
in the player_t::specialsector field to denote negative tag- and floor
flat image -based water content, respectively. It also used
visplane_t::picnum value 1998 to denote a water plane.

Removed completely, as we now have better methods for creating water.
