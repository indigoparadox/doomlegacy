<h2>[1] INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>  
  Hello all Doom fans of the world, here is the latest release of
  Doom Legacy project by Team Legacy.

  Well, if you are reading this you probably know by now that the
  gods at id Software have released the sources of the greatest game
  on earth : Doom !!

  Of course a lot of projects have started around the sources since
  about January 1998, and Doom LEGACY is competing to be the best of
  the choices!

  We have always dreamed of Doom sources being released, and all the
  features that we'd like to add. Since Doom1 was out we are fans
  of deathmatching. Don't ask us why we like it more than Duke Nukem
  or other clones, we like the atmosphere of Doom and its like that!

  This new version of the Doom engine is not commercial.
  You will need an IWAD to play, which can be one of the original Doom
  or Heretic wad files
  (doom.wad from Doom, doomu.wad from Ultimate Doom,
  doom2.wad from Doom2, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from Final Doom,
  heretic.wad from Heretic, which are still copyright of id Software).

  There are some free replacement IWAD which can be used instead.
  FreeDoom (doom2.wad or freedoom.wad) is a free substitute for Doom2.
  Blasphemer (heretic.wad) is a free substitute for Heretic, but it does
  not have monsters yet (it needs volunteers to work on it).

  The Legacy engine will recognize and play Chexquest (chex.wad),
  Chexquest2, and Chexquest-Newmaps (newmaps.wad), but not Chexquest3.

  Legacy has implemented the Boom extensions.

  Legacy also has Legacy 3Dfloors, Legacy swimable water and other
  special effects using extended linedef codes, and fragglescript.
  The Legacy 3Dfloors and fragglescript are demonstrated in:
  Legacy_3ddemo.wad, rainbowstar.wad
  Some of the wads that use Legacy 3Dfloors are:
  3DHorror.wad, phobia.wad, hth2.wad
  Some Deathmatch wads:
  andydm1.wad, shbullet.wad
  Chexquest sequel:
  Chexquest-newmaps.wad

  If you have problems running this version or want more information,
  first: READ THE FAQ. If the FAQ doesn't help, contact us at:
  legacy project at sourceforge.net.

  We hope that this new version brings you a lot of enjoyment,
  especially for the deathmatch fans out there.

  Have much fun!!
</p>  

<h3>[1-1]: What's new</h3>
<p>
  See <a href="whatsnew.html">here</a> for the latest changes.
</p>

<h3>[1-2]: What's coming</h3>
<p>  
  We have planned other features. See our site:
  http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net
</p>

  
<h2>[2] INSTALLATION OF DOOM LEGACY</h2>

  Doom Legacy is a addon of one of the id Sofware games : Doom,
  Doom II, Ultimate Doom, Final Doom or Doom Shareware.
  So it should be installed in the directory where you have
  one of the previous version of Doom.

  It won't replace any existing file from the original Doom.

  Doom Legacy will run in the mode of the original Doom version
  where it is installed. That is, if you have installed Legacy in
  Ultimate Doom directory, it will act like Ultimate Doom, pro-
  viding 4 episodes, and no super shotgun.

  Under Windows, you have a additionnal launcher, to configure
  Doom Legacy. In game mode menu you can configure the game between
  Doom, Doom2, Ultimate Doom, ... Just put the corresponding wad.

  See "-iwad" option for more.

<h3>[2-1]: Setting up the game</h3>

  Legacy uses 'config.cfg' to setup the game.
  Your personal control settings are saved in your config.cfg file.
  They can be changed by menus in Legacy, and are saved when quitting
  the game.

  OpenGL uses a separate file, 'glconfig.cfg', so that the opengl
  settings do not disturb an existing good config file. This does
  mean that switching to opengl requires setting up the controls again.

  There won't be any problems with the original Doom config
  file 'default.cfg' : it will never be changed.
  To configure your original Doom, use SETUP.EXE.

  Under windows you can use the launcher to configure and launch
  Doom Legacy.

  
<h3>[2-2]: Setting up the controls</h3>

  Setting up the controls, mouse and joystick, video mode is done
  while in the game, using the main game menus : Setup Controls,
  Video Options, Game Options. You can change all game settings
  at any time during the game.

  The mouse will be activated as default, to disable it, change
  the 'use_mouse' variable in the console (see console.txt)

  The joystick will not be used as default, set the 'use_joystick'
  variable at the console, to one of the joystick types supported
  by Legacy (up to 10button joysticks + hat, see console.txt)

  OpenGL has its own config file, 'glconfig.cfg', which means
  that switching to opengl requires setting up all the controls again.

  

<h3>[2-3]: Setting up the sound</h3>

  SDL:
  ---
  The SDL library handles sound. If that is installed correctly then
  Legacy will have sound effects.

  Music requires SDL-Mixer version 1.2.7 or later. Earlier SDL-Mixer
  versions do not have a working RWOPS interface. Legacy can play music
  using files instead, but it requires compiling Legacy, allowing it to
  detect the SDL-Mixer version.

  WINDOWS:
  -------
  The sound is autodetected using DirectX so make sure your card works
  well with DirectX and it legacy will us it.

  Additionally the Legacy could utilize the hardware 3D sound
  for making more realistic sound environment.

  Specify -ds3d command line parameter to use generic 3D sound driver
  (DirectSound 3D). This driver are suitable for most 3D sound chips.

  DOS:
  ---
  The sound and music card is auto-detected at the game startup.

  If you don't get any sound in Legacy, check that the BLASTER
  variable is set. Type 'set' at the dos prompt (or dosbox under
  Windows) : do you see a line like 'BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 ...' ?
  If not, run the installation of your soundcard for Dos mode,
  it will usually modify your autoexec.bat so that the BLASTER
  variable will be set. See the FAQ.TXT for more.

  If the BLASTER variable is set, but you still don't hear any
  sounds, or the sounds are not right, then edit the SOUND.CFG
  file, and manually set your type of soundcard, see there for
  more.

  

<h3>[2-4]: Tuning up the mouse speed</h3>

  The main Options menu still limits the mouse sensitivity value
  to a 'normal range', but you can now increase this value even
  more using the console variables 'mousesens' and 'mlooksens'.

  If you used to edit default.cfg for the mouse sensitivity,
  forget about it and use the console!

  

<h3>[2-5]: the Setup Controls menu</h3>

  You can bind actions to one or two keys, like in all decent Games.
  Select an action, press ENTER, and then activate the desired key,
  mouse button, or joystick button.

  To CLEAR the keys attached to a control, use the BACKSPACE key.

  To setup the DOUBLE CLICK for mouse/joystick buttons : enter the
  click one time, so that it displays, eg: 'MOUSEBUTTON1'. Then
  re-enter the click a second time, and it will transform into a
  dbl-click, eg: 'MOUSEBUTTON1' will become 'DOUBLEMOUSE1'.

  You can use double-clicks for any joystick/mouse button, and you
  can attach any action to it.

  When controlperkey is "Several", a single key can be set to 
  multiple actions, eg: go backward and 'use' at the same time.
  Normally when a key is set for an action, previous uses of the
  same key are cleared.

  
<h3>[2-6]: Using a Second mouse</h3>

  Doom Legacy supports a second mouse on the SERIAL port, to allow
  both players in split-screen mode to play with a mouse.
  This mouse should be MS-Compatible or Logitech.
  The menu related to the secondary mouse is in the player two
  configuration menu (from the mutliplayer menu).
  Plug the mouse in one of your serial ports (COM1/COM2/COM3/COM4)
  then go to the menu and set FIRST mouse2port to the port you have
  plugged the mouse in, then switch "use secondary mouse" to On.
  It should work :).

  Problems :
  ----------
  - Under Windows, the secondary mouse MUST NOT be detected by windows.
  Make sure it is not connected to your computer until Windows
  has finished startup, then connect it. If you let the secondary
  mouse be connected during the boot, Windows will detect it and will
  want to install drivers for it, which is what you DON'T want! :)
  Doom Legacy itself handles the secondary mouse directly, without
  the need of an additional mouse driver.
  - If the secondary mouse is not detected by Doom Legacy, and you
  are sure the mouse is well connected to the serial port, toggle
  "use secondary mouse" to 'force' in the game menu. This will
  skip the detection and assume the mouse is there.

  Note:
  -----
  - We assume you already have one mouse, the one you normally use,
  and then you add another mouse to the serial port. Your normal
  mouse is used with it's normal driver. Therefore you can use whatever
  mouse you want (USB, PS/2, ....) for your first mouse. But use a
  serial mouse for the second mouse.

<h3>[2-7]: Gamma controls</h3>

  The control of gamma is much finer than before. The gamma table is
  now generated by equation from the control settings, instead of using
  4 preset gamma tables.

  The gamma control functions:

  Gamma: Only has a gamma slider.

  Gamma_black : Gamma control and black level control.

  Gamma_bright_black : Gamma control, bright control, and black
  level control.

  Linear : Has bright and black level controls, as two set-points
  of linear segmented brightness correction. It is included
  for use with LCD and other technology displays. 

  Controls for gamma function, black level, bright level, and gamma
  are on an options page. The values can also be changed by a
  console set command, or in your personal config.cfg file.
  gammafunc Gamma_bright_black
  black -2
  gamma 2
  bright -1

  To see the current setting just type the name, without a value.

  Normal levels are
  black 0
  gamma 0

  Find a dark area in a wad or use the gamma.wad file
  ( i.e. -file gamma.wad).
  Set the black level to give a good looking even gray scale in the
  darkest areas (little gray room in gamma.wad).
  White textures will not go completely to black, but will instead stay
  gray. The game video is limited to 32 light levels, so do not try to
  get it perfect in the darkest three gray test strips as it is not
  possible. Instead try to get the gray intervals even. You should be
  able to just barely see an object right in front of you in the darkest
  room, and see white textures across the room as a dark gray patch.

  Go to a normally lit area and adjust gamma to give the brightness and
  evenness of tone that you would expect.

  Use the bright control to adjust the brightest outdoor scenes
  after the gamma and black levels are set. Unlike most monitors,
  this bright control actually controls the brightest light levels.

  Your preferences may be different. From experiments, trying too
  hard to set a perfect black leads to extreme gamma settings to correct
  for the side effects. It is a compromise, as actual hardware varies,
  and the gamma table equations represent ideal CRT behavior.
  LCD monitor gamma response is even less ideal.

  Evenness is more important than absolute brightness. The brightness
  appearance is affected greatly by the amount of light over your monitor.
  If the wall textures look harsh, then the gamma is set too high, or
  the black level is set to low.

  
<h2>[3] ADDITIONS TO GAME PLAY</h2>

<h3>[3-1]: Shooting up and down</h3>

  There's nothing changed, except of course a totally new
  deathmatch experience.

  
  About the BFG : the bfg ball can be fired up or down, but
  the invisible rays that spray from you are totally independent of
  your aiming. The invisible BFG rays have always 'autoaim', they're
  not dependent of your aim. Let's be clear: apart from being able
  to shoot the BIG BFG BALL up or down, the side-effect of the BFG
  is like before.

  
<h3>[3-2]: Auto aim toggle</h3>

  We wanted to keep the compatibility with the older Doom gameplay,
  but we needed also to go forward and bring some more depth to the
  deathmatches. On of these steps, is going for the manual-aiming.

  You may feel like it's unbalanced if some people use the autoaim,
  as they don't have to do the effort of aiming right, and others
  don't use it and do their best to aim up and down right...

  NEW since Legacy v1.2 : with allowautoaim (see console.txt) , you can
  disable autoaiming, that is, impose manual aim to all players
  in a network game, use with caution!!

  
<h3>[3-3]: Weapon changes</h3>

  We didn't dare of course change the existing weapons functionality!

  You may appreciate however, the fact that you can remap every
  weapon to any key, in the Setup Controls menu. Since you can map two
  keys per 'control', you can keep the original keys '1'-'8' for the
  weapons, and add a shortcut to your preferred ones. eg: '5' and 'r'
  for rockets...

  New weapons are planned in the future releases: probably a grenade
  nearly like Quake1 ones. Maybe an addon for the rocket launcher to
  transform it into a 'guided rockets' launcher... like the Revenant's
  fireballs.

  
<h3>[3-4]: New cheats</h3>

  'idcd##' : Will work only if MSCDEX driver is loaded.
  Similar to the 'idcmus##', but for CD Audio tracks.
  Example : idcd02 start cd track 2.

  'idfly' : Fly around levels, using 'jump' key to get altitude.

  
<h3>[3-5] Heretic support</h3>

  Legacy now can handle heretic.wad as a main wad file, so starting 
  legacy with heretic.wad in the same directory or launching it with
  "-iwad heretic.wad" will set legacy into 'heretic state'.

  What have added heretic support to the doom engine so the result 
  isn't exactly heretic engine, so we hope there is not much trouble 
  running heretic wad and modifications. For this reason old demo 
  playback cannot be supported. 

  Heretic has inherited the legacy new features : better 
  network support, opengl, boom support. Also some heretic stuff
  can now be used by doom, like ambient sounds, we can now trigger a
  'weapons switch linedef' with a missile hit, and legacy can use
  "fontbxxx" lumps for the big font graphics....

<h3>[3-6] Opengl compatibility</h3>

  OpenGL uses the SDL library OpenGL support and depends on the
  SDL OpenGL support working. The video card usually requires
  drivers from the manufacturer to get full hardware rendering.
  With the default video card drivers, OpenGL will be software
  rendered by the SDL library, which will be slow.

  Card Driver Observations
  ATI RageFury ????? Work fine
  S3 ProSavage 4.12.01 Work fine
  Voodoo Banshee 1.04.01 Work only in 16 bit mode
  Voodoo 5500 1.04.00 work fine

  
<h3>[3-7] Savegame directories</h3>

  Legacy allows savegame directories, with up to 99 savegames in each
  directory. This feature can be enabled/disabled by a compile time option.

  The savegame entries now include the level name and play time.
  The savegames now have a readable header with this and more information,
  including the command line switches used.

  The cursor movement keys are up-arrow, down-arrow, page-up, and page-down.
  The delete key will delete the selected savegame or directory.

  The savegame menus now include a directory name.
  The directory is selected by moving the cursor up to the directory name,
  and pressing ENTER. The menu will present all the existing directory
  names. The blank directory line is the legacy default directory
  which contains all the directories and savegames.

  To create a new directory, move to the directory line, press ENTER,
  type in a new directory name, and press ENTER.

  
<h2>[4] THE CONSOLE</h2>
<p>  
Check <a href="console.html">here</a> for more about the console.
</p>

  
<h2>[5] NETWORK GAME (MULTIPLAYER)</h2>
<p>  
  IMPORTANT NOTE!

  NEW, since Legacy v1.2, the network part of Doom has been totally
  rewritten. It now uses a better transfer method for the packets,
  (which is usually faster), and also implements a basic
  Client/Server model, where some critical game options are
  changeable only by the server in multiplayer games.

  Since the network communication is faster, we have upped
  the number of players to 32 !!
</p>

<h3>[5-0]: Network under Windows and Linux</h3>

  The win32/Linux version of legacy does not rely upon external
  programs like sersetup, ipxsetup, dm, doomatic, hx8. This
  version directly uses winsock/socket api. So the only way to
  play in network is to use the -server and -connect parameters.
  Or use the launcher, which has a beautiful interface that will
  translate your wishes in command line.
  You can also use the build in multiplayer menu that allow you 
  to connect to server and create server.

<h3>[5-1]: Quick-start of a 5-32 players network game (DOS only)</h3>

  With DOS, to start a game with more than 4 players, we recommend using
  Doomatic. Doomatic is a utility written by us before the source
  release, we wanted to create a deathmatch launcher with all the
  features that we always needed.

  It replaces IPXSETUP and DM. Just read the 'QUICK START' section
  of DOOMATIC.TXT file to get started with Doomatic.

  Since we've added more than 4 players support into Doom LEGACY,
  we have modified DOOMATIC to allow starting games with up to
  32 players.

  Make sure that the map you use has enough deathmatch starts!

  Search on internet Doom sites, there has been a number of wads
  specifically made for the new Doom ports with more than 4 players.

  Cooperative play with more than 4 players should work with map
  using the JDS cooperative player starts.

  
<h3>[5-2]: the new Client/Server model</h3>

  The network code has been totally rewritten, here are the
  main changes:

  - Doom Legacy allows players to join while a game is in progress.
  No need to restart the game to add a new player ! For the Dos user,
  this is not allowed with old drivers as it works only with doomatic
  and with the -server and -connect parameters.

  - Doom Legacy version 1.2 and higher supports up to 32 players.

  - The speed is now dependent upon the Server. if the server loses
  frames, that is: if it runs too slow, all the other players will
  experience the slow down, or 'choppiness'.

  Thus, make sure that the server's machine runs smooth, example:

  a P100 running the game at 320X200 may be very smooth. while
  a PII 300 at 1024x768 will slow down the network. Why? simply
  because while the server is occupied drawing his screen, he can't
  send or receive any packets, and thus the other players are slowed
  down at the speed of the server (well, now it is possible that
  a PII 300 is very smooth at 1024x768.. but you get the idea).

  - The memory is very important so 16 Mb is a MINIMUM for a server.
  Why? Because a server with not enough memory will often load
  data from the disk, and this will probably slow down the game.

  - Player machines should have a disk cache (swap), like 4 Mb or more.
  A good disk cache will reduce the loading from the server, thus
  reduce possible slow downs.

  - The server can kick any player out of the game. The player will
  be returned to the title screen.

  - Consistancy failure now only kicks out the player who was not
  'up-to-date', not the others.

  - Parameters -left -right came back (using 3 screens for left,right
  and front views).

  - Most critical game variables are sent to all the players when they
  are changed on the server, and only the server can change them.

  Examples are 'allowjump', 'respawnitemtime', 'deathmatch', ...

  - The new possibilities are barely demonstrated in Legacy v1.2 :
  we can now make any console command work on the network, so there
  are very good things ahead!

  For MS-DOS, the new system is still compatible with IPXSETUP and
  SERSETUP, so you can use these to play games up to 4 players.

  To play with up to 32 players, use DOOMATIC.

  Note that DOOMATIC was created by us long before the release of the
  Doom sources, and it works with the orginal Doom, and with most
  other ports, too. We didn't create DOOMATIC specifically for Legacy,
  but we updated it so that it could start games with more than 4
  players for Legacy.

  

<h3>[5-3]: Setting up the SERVER (DOS ONLY)</h3>

  There is no interface for now.

  The server is the player 0, which is the GREEN player in DOOMATIC.

  Note that the GREEN player in Doomatic, is not necessarily Green
  later in the game : the server can choose any color in the
  Multiplayer menu. Legacy doesn't use the colors from Doomatic,
  but will recognise the Green player of Doomatic as the server.

  In other words, you can't choose who is the server using IPXSETUP.

  We reassure you: this is a hack, and we will add a '-server'
  parameter as soon as possible to determine explicitly the server.

  The color you choose in Doomatic is useful for the original Doom
  game only : it was a key feature of Doomatic, to choose the colour
  you wanted to be instead of getting always the same color from
  IPXSETUP. It became obsolete with Legacy, as you can choose your
  color in the game itself.

  The SERVER has more rights in the game, and no, it can't cheat.
  It can change the game parameters like 'repspawnitem','respawn-
  monsters', ect. and can kick out players. Therefore, choose the server
  with attention.

  NOTE that there is no 'dedicated' server for now, everybody in
  a multiplayer game and even single player, is always a server
  and a client at the same time. That is: in single player, you
  can slow down yourself, when you loose frames, usually in the
  higher resolutions, you will experience a small 'lag' like on
  a 'choppy' multiplayer game.

  See CONSOLE.TXT for more about the server &amp; multiplayer commands.

  

<h3>[5-4]: the return of -left/-right</h3>

  We have restored the -left and -right command-line parameters,
  that allowed in the earlier versions of Doom, to play using
  3 monitors: one for the front view, one for the left, and one
  for the right.

  Here is how it works:

  Use DOOMATIC and create a game on the machine that will display
  the 'front view'. Make sure it has the GREEN player color
  (in Doomatic, not in Legacy). Set '-left' and '-right' in the
  local parameters of Doomatic, for the other two machines.
  That is : the 'left view' machine has '-left' in the local
  parameters of Doomatic, the 'right view' machine has '-right'.

  Join the game with the other two computers, and start the game.

  This will work only for SINGLE player, but the player will have
  a very wide view!

  

<h3>[5-5]: How to play with TCP/IP</h3>

  You can use The launcher to start such game. or use the build in 
  multiplayer menu that have 'create server' and 'connect server' 
  option.

  BY HAND
  -------

  Someone will be the server, it is usually the fastest computer.

  A client NEVER slows down the server, but a slow server
  SLOWS DOWN ALL THE CLIENTS!

  * The server types:

  &gt; legacy -server &lt;num-of-computers&gt;

  The server will wait until the specified number of computers have
  connected and then will start the game. This is like the old way to
  start a game. It is more fair because all players start at the same
  time and with the same weapons. Of course other computers can also
  join later.

  or 

  &gt; legacy -server 
  This starts the server and does not wait for any computers.
  It starts the game immediately. Other players can join later.

  

  * Clients are the other players who join in the server:

  &gt; legacy -connect &lt;ip address of server&gt;

  or

  &gt; legacy -connect
  This will auto-detect a server on a LAN. This only works when
  computers are directly connected. If you play through internet,
  the server can NOT be auto-detected, and you must specify it's
  IP address.

  
  Example A, 3 players on a LAN:

  player 1 (the server)
  &gt; legacy -server 3

  player 2 (client)
  &gt; legacy -connect

  player 3 (client)
  &gt; legacy -connect

  Example B, 2 players, through internet:

  player 1 (the server)
  &gt; legacy -server 2

  player 2 (client)
  &gt; legacy -connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

  Example C, a 3 player game, with _TWO_ computers, one is split-screen:

  player 1 (the server)
  &gt; legacy -server 3

  player 2 and 3 (2 clients on the same computer)
  &gt; legacy -splitscreen -connect

  
  You don't need to put all parameters on the client side like :
  -deathmatch, -warp xx, -respawn, -fast, etc because the server
  automatically sends those to all clients upon connection.

  Also the -file parameter is not needed by the player anymore. The server
  will send the file needed to the client. Let's say rather the client
  can download it from the server. But of course the client will first
  check for the file in the directory or subdirectory.

  Use '-notime' to disable file date check on clients. Normally
  the game will warn you if a client has a file loaded by the
  server, but with a different date. Clients should have the exact
  same version of the files added by the server.

  You want to know some things : you need a good ping value, perfect
  is less than 30, more than this will be very unplayable, because
  there is not, for the moment, code to reduce the latency between
  command entered at keyboard and command execution.

  In other words, Doom Legacy doesn't use 'interpolation' to make
  you believe like the game is 'smooth' when it is not in reality.

  

<h3>[5-6]: Playing Legacy over modem </h3>

  WIN32
  -----

  You must emulate a tcp/ip network using your modem. You can do 
  this using DUN form Microsoft. Read the faq for more.

  
  MS-DOS ONLY
  -----------

  DOOMATIC, doesn't support modem play as today.

  There are several problems with the original SERSETUP. And with most
  of their equivalents like SER7-5 and others.

  We no longer support the original SERSETUP and recommend using 'HX8'.

  We have currently only received positive feedback with 'HX8' :
  people have succesfully played Doom Legacy in serial, even with
  8 players using 'daisy-chain'. It was told to us that using more
  than 2 players and modem is feasible too with 'HX8', but it is
  a little more difficult to set up.

  We will appreciate more feedback to be sure it works fine. Send
  us your positive or negatve experiences with this.

  HX8 works also with Hexen and other Id games, you'll find it here:

  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/utils/serial/hx8.zip

  

<h3>[5-7]: Network parameters</h3>

  The following game parameters are changeable only by the SERVER,
  using the console and menu:

  (they also work in single player since in single player you are
  the server AND the client)

  allowjump, allowautoaim,
  respawnitem, respawnitemtime,
  respawnmonsters, respawnmonstertime,
  gravity, bloodtime, solidecorps,
  fraglimit, deathmatch
  since 1.29 there are many more parameters so not all are listed here.

  Of course all the player parameters works in network :
  name, color, autoaim, weaponpref, originalweaponswitch.

  See CONSOLE.TXT for more about multiplayer commands.

  
<h3>[5-8]: HOW DOES LEGACY HANDLE THE MULTIPLAYER STARTS ?</h3>

  Doom LEGACY supports the extended player starts defined by
  the JDS group : 4001 to 4060 for player 5 to player 64.

  Those player starts are for cooperative, looks like JDS
  wanna have 64 players cooperative games !

  Doom LEGACY supports up to 64 deathmatch starts, but the
  original Doom games used up to 10 dm starts.

  Thus, for compatibility with the existing maps, Legacy
  will use the player starts if all the deathmatch starts
  in a map are occupied. If all the player starts are
  occupied (including extended ones), then a dm start
  chosen randomly will be used.. and players might get
  stuck together, but this will happen normally only
  at the beginning of games with maps with few dm starts.

  
<h3>[5-9]: The new intermision screen</h3>

  FRAGS : the usual frags rankings

  BUCHOLZ: a chess scoring system: you earn more points,
  when you frag a good player. That is, a player that
  has a lot of frags at the end of the game. This is
  more balanced that the original frags system, because
  you can do less frags, but on good players, while
  in the original system, 'newbies' players could
  score as much frags between them. Also a good player
  won't earn a lot of points if he goes for easy targets,
  so he'll better choose an challenging enough target.
  Chess players will know this system (Boris is a very
  good chess player :)

  Seriously if F is the frag table like player i have fraged
  player j F[i][j] times. The total frags of a player i is
  F[i][1]+F[i][2]+ ... + F[i][32] we can call this Total[i]
  there bucholz of a player i is
  F[i][1]*Total[1] + F[i][2]*Total[2] + ... + F[i][32]*Total[32]

  INDIVIDUAL: the players are all compared 1 to 1, when a
  player wins he earns 3 points, if they draw they each
  get 1 point, then all the points are added and the
  winner is the one with the more points. This was
  suggested by Cristian Romero (romero-c@usa.net).
  Is is not perfect, but is already interesting enough:
  think of it more 'individual'. You have to make more frags
  compared to each other player to earn points. So you will
  want to go on players that you can make more frags, and
  forget about the ones which have already too much frags
  compared to you. Go for the victories, more than the frags.

  DEATHS: this ranking shows the players who have died the
  most!!

<h3>[5-10]: Firewall handling</h3>

  Legacy uses udp port 5029 only and can accept messages from any
  port so it works perfectly with NAT (Network Address Translation)
  and such (like IPmaskareding of linux).

  Because the ip of any computer behind the firewall is not routable 
  the server cannot get a usable ip address during player join-game.
  If you are familiar with IpAutoforward funtionality of Linux,
  you can make a usable ip appear.

  
<h2>[6] COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h2>
<p>  
  There's a new environment variable 'DOOMWADDIR' that you can set
  to the path where the original Doom and LEGACY Doom wad files are.
  This allows running LEGACY from any directory on your harddrive. By
  default, LEGACY searches its wad files in "." dir (the current dir).

  Here's the new parameters that you can use from the command prompt.

  In DOOMATIC, you can add command-line options as a server in the
  Server menu's Add Parameters, or in the Prefs menu 'Local parms'.
  (the Local parms will be used only on your side, while the server
  parms are sent to everybody)

  

  Additional parameters info:
  ---------------------------

  +&lt;any console prompt&gt;

  You can put all console command at command line, Legacy will
  execute it first.

  
  -iwad &lt;iwad-file&gt;

  The iwad file supplies the game basics, determines which
  version of Doom, Heretic, or Chex is being played, and changes the
  Legacy engine behavior accordingly.

  
  -file &lt;pwad-file&gt;
  -file &lt;dehacked-file&gt;

  Loads a file that replaces some of the iwad data, and otherwise
  modifies the game.

  Has been enhanced to load dehacked files too! It makes
  it much more easy to use deahcked patches in multiplayer,
  for example:

  -file gfx.wad snd.wad patch.deh

  
  -game &lt;game-name&gt;

  Forces a particular game mode to be used. This replaces renaming
  the wad file. If an iwad is not explicitly given, the appropriate
  iwad will be automatically loaded.

  The valid game-name at this time are:
  doom, doommode : Doom1 behavior
  freedu, doomu, ultimode : Ultimate Doom behavior
  freedoom, freedm, doom2, plutonia, tnt : Doom2 behavior
  blasphem, heretic, heremode : Heretic behavior
  heretic1 : Heretic shareware behavior
  chex1 : Chexquest behavior
  The following are valid game-name, but the mode is not supported yet.
  hexen, hexemode : Hexen behavior
  hexen1 : Hexen demo behavior
  strife : Strife behavior
  strife0 : Strife demo behavior

  Savegames are now marked with the game name, and will not load
  with a different game name.

  
  -teamplay
  -teamskin

  Similar to the good old '-deathmatch', this activates team
  play by either color (teamplay) or skin (teamskin).

  
  -nocd

  
  Disable checking for the cd driver. In case you have a faulty
  cd driver, this will prevent troubles. The functionality is
  equivalent to -nomusic and -nosound.

  
  -dehacked &lt;dehfile.deh&gt; [dehfile.deh] [ect...]
  -deh

  DooM LEGACY supports the dehacked patches... of course its
  now done a more subtle way : you just specify the dehacked
  patch file at the command prompt, no need to patch the exe!

  You can specify multiple .deh files, and they will all be
  executed, on the order you have put them on the command line.

  Since 1.25 dehacked file can be loaded using -file option.
  Also since the 1.30, legacy can load dehacked lump in a wad file.

  
  -mb &lt;number&gt;

  If you run out of memory, or want more memory, this sets the
  number of megabytes of memory to allocate to ZALLOC at
  Doom startup. ZALLOC is used for saving the directories, textures,
  and other lumps of the wad files. Executable and stack use other
  memory.

  If no parameter is set Legacy will try to allocate 24 to 80 Mb.
  If that much is not available, then it will ask for half of what is
  free.
  The MIN and MAX limits are set by compile time options.

  There are several compile time options for ZALLOC memory allocation,
  the updated Zone allocation, automatic growing Zone allocation,
  and simple and tagged malloc allocations.

  
  -width &lt;xxx&gt; -height &lt;yyy&gt;

  If you like the pain, you can set the screen size at the
  command line instead of using the new 'Video Mode' menu.

  Doom LEGACY will switch to 320x200 if it can't find a
  corresponding mode. So remember to load your Univbe or
  equivalent for extra video modes.

  -ds3d

  Tell legacy to use Direct 3D Sound for the sound, you will
  get much better sound position in 3d and better sound effects.

  -opengl

  Uses the opengl driver provided by the operating system, or SDL
  library.

  This will use hardware rendering if the OpenGL driver supports it.
  Without a hardware rendering video driver, SDL will perform
  software renderering, which will be slow.

  The hardware renderer uses a different graphics engine from the software
  renderer and does not do everything that the software renderer does.
  It does have coronas, and other light effects that the software
  renderer does not do.

  -3dfx

  The Voodoo hardware accelerated 3d card is used to draw the game,
  which is a big differance in the rendering engine.

  Uses the glide api. Works only on voodoo chipset of 3dfx.
  This is highly optimized to use voodoo functions (only 16bit).

  The rest of the command line options are like the Doom2 original. All
  the standard parameters are still functional.

<h2>[7] NOTES</h2>

  
<h3>[7-5] Dehacked patch note</h3>
<p>  
  We don't check for the dehacked patch version, we added support for the
  patches version 6, it should run ok with (not too) old patches.

  If you have a problem with the version of the patch, try to convert it.
  Just load the .deh file into a recent version of Dehacked (3.0),
  and then save it again. It will then be saved as a text-file, that
  Legacy will be able to use.

  All text changes are supported, you can edit the .deh manually and
  replace strings by larger strings than the original Doom, it works.
  Sprite renaming works too, well, pretty anything :)

  If you can't run your dehacked patch with Legacy, please mail us!
