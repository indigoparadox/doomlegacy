<h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>  
  Hello all Doom fans of the world, welcome to the latest release of
  Doom Legacy!
</p>
<p>
  Since Doom was out we have been fans of deathmatching. Don't ask us
  why, but we liked Doom more than Duke Nukem, Quake or other clones.
  We simply enjoy the atmosphere, look and feel of Doom.
  We always dreamed of Doom sources being released. How many days we
  spent talking about the features we'd put in it!
  In the middle of 1997 we heard a rumour that the Doom sources
  would be released. Some months later the miracle happened: In
  December 1997, id Software made the full source code of Doom public.
  A great number of open source projects have started around the sources
  since, and Doom Legacy is competing to be the best of the choices!
</p>
<p>
  Doom Legacy can play Doom, Boom, and Heretic maps.
  In addition to the original games by id Software and Raven Software,
  there are hundreds of free, fan-made maps available on the Internet.
  These maps are typically distributed as PWAD files, which are not
  fully self-contained.
  For each game you will also need the corresponding IWAD data file,
  which contains all the graphics,
  sounds and music in the game. For example, if you want to play Doom II
  maps, you'll need the file "doom2.wad".
  Doom Legacy itself is free software, meaning that you can copy and
  distribute it without charge.
  The original Doom and Heretic IWAD files
  (doom.wad from Doom, doomu.wad from Ultimate Doom,
  doom2.wad from Doom2, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from Final Doom,
  heretic.wad from Heretic), which are still
  copyrighted products and available commercially.
</p>
<p>
  There are also some free replacement IWADs which can be used instead.
  <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/freedoom/">FreeDoom</a> (doom2.wad or freedoom.wad) is a free substitute for Doom2.
  <a href="http://www.jeshimoth.com/jutegyte/blasphemer/">Blasphemer</a>
  (heretic.wad) is a free substitute for Heretic, but it does
  not have monsters yet (it needs volunteers to work on it!).
  The Legacy engine will recognize and play Chexquest (chex.wad),
  Chexquest2, and Chexquest-Newmaps (newmaps.wad), but not Chexquest3.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the now
  fundamental <a href="http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Boom">Boom</a>
  extensions, Legacy also has implemented among other things
  3D floors, swimmable water and other special effects using extended
  linedef codes, and supports the FraggleScript scripting language.
</p>
<p>
  To get started with Legacy, we recommend the following PWADs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The new editing features are demonstrated in
    Legacy_3ddemo.wad and rainbowstar.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Wads that use Legacy 3D floors:
    3DHorror.wad, phobia.wad, hth2.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Deathmatch wads:
    andydm1.wad, shbullet.wad
  </li>
  <li>
    Chexquest sequel:
    Chexquest-newmaps.wad
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We hope that this new version brings you a lot of enjoyment.
  Have much fun!!
</p>
<p>-The Doom Legacy Team</p>

<h3>What's new</h3>
<p>
  See <a href="whatsnew.html">here</a> for the latest changes.
</p>

<h3>What's coming</h3>
<p>  
  We have planned other features. See our <a href="http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net">website</a>.
</p>

  
<h2 id="install">INSTALL</h2>

<p>
  Installing Doom Legacy is simple, just follow these steps:
  
</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
  Choose a legacy game directory that all players can use, like /usr/local/games/legacy.
  Install the tar file contents to the legacy game directory, which needs to include the
  doomlegacy binary, legacy.wad, autoexec.cfg.  The tar file will also install the legacy docs there.
  You can also put there any wad files you want to play.
<p>
  The iwad files can be in a separate directory (such as /usr/local/games/legacy/wads).
  You can set DOOMWADDIR with that wad directory path, in a login script, or a game starting script.
  If DOOMWADDIR is not set, then DoomLegacy will look for the directories:
  "/usr/local/share/games/doomwads" and "/usr/local/games/doomwads".
<p>
  Otherwise, for known game wads (Doom, Doom2, TNT, etc) in other directories, make soft links in the legacy game directory
  to the actual wad files, so that when a -game switch is used, DoomLegacy can find the iwad.
<br>
<pre>
  > ln -s wads/idgames/doom1.wad  doom1.wad
  > ln -s wads/idgames/doom2.wad  doom2.wad
  > ln -s wads/idgames/doomu.wad  doomu.wad
  > ln -s wads/idgames/plutonia.wad  plutonia.wad
  > ln -s wads/idgames/tnt.wad  tnt.wad
  > ln -s wads/freedoom-iwad-0.7/doom2.wad  freedoom.wad
</pre>
<p>
  If just the pwad files are in a separate directory (such as pwad/),
  then there are no extra steps.
<pre>
  > doomlegacy -file pwad/ANDYDM.WAD
  > doomlegacy -file pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.DEH pwad/Twilight/TWILIGHT.WAD
</pre>
  DoomLegacy will use the HOME environment variable, which is usually set by your Linux login, to find your home directory.  It makes a .legacy directory there, where it will keep config.cfg and all your saved games.
  If HOME is not set, DoomLegacy will look for directory
  "/usr/local/games/legacyhome", and if that is not present then will
  use the current directory.  In the HOME directory, it will make a hidden directory, ".legacy",
  within which it will save config and savegames.
<pre>
  Overriding by using the -home and -config switches, examples:
  > doomlegacy -home ~/doomstuff -game plutonia
  > doomlegacy -home ~/doom -config ~/doom/plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</pre>
<pre>
  DoomLegacy execution examples:
  > doomlegacy -game tnt
  > doomlegacy -game plutonia -file pwad/pl2/PL2.WAD
  > doomlegacy -iwad freedoom.wad -file new_map13.wad
</pre>
<p>
  Script files can also be used to start DoomLegacy.
<pre>
  create dm8 script file
    #!/bin/sh
    cd /usr/local/games/legacy/
    USER="Shotgun-wizard"
    DOOMWADDIR=wads
    doomlegacy -iwad doom2.wad -file DM8.WAD
 > chmod u+x dm8
 > dm8
</pre>

<p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  It is important to change to the directory where doomlegacy resides.  Support files,
  like wads, legacy.wad, autoexec.cfg, and config.cfg, need to be found by DoomLegacy
  and it looks in the current directory as last resort.
<p>
  Put your wad files in directory "\doomwads", or "\games\doomwads", or
  in the current directory.  DoomLegacy will use the first that exists
  as the doomwaddir.  Set DOOMWADDIR in a batch file to specify a different wad directory.
<p>
  A "legacy" directory will be created in your home directory for savegames and saved config files.
  Set the environment variable "HOME" in a batch file, or use the -home switch
  when starting DoomLegacy.
  Otherwise, it will check if the default home directory exists, "\legacyhome".
  If none are present, then it will use the current directory for home, but only if it is not root, "c:\".
<pre>
  Overriding by using the -home and -config switches, examples:
  > doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -game plutonia
  > doomlegacy -home c:\games\doomsave -config c:\games\plutconfig.cfg -game plutonia
</pre>
<p>
  Use the verbose switch -v, and DoomLegacy will print to stderr the directory
  names that it used.  On Win98 this becomes a file named stderr.
  The use of directory names with spaces may fail.
<p>
  It is difficult to start a program under windows and set command line switches.
  Most of the settings that the launcher supported can now be set from menus and the console.
  However the -game, -file, and -config must be set from command line switches.
<p>
  One way is to create shortcuts to doomlegacy.  Specify in the shortcut the command line
  and change starting directory to where the doomlegacy program resides.
<pre>
  Example shortcut for DoomLegacy with plutonia2 wad:
  Shortcut: dl_plut2
    command: doomlegacy -game plutonia -file c:\games\pl2\PL2.WAD
    current directory: c:\games\legacydir
</pre>
<p>
  Another way is to create a batch file for each combination of switches, and run the
  batch file to start doomlegacy.
  Batch file examples (where legacydir, homedir, configdir, and waddir stand for directories that you specify).
<br>
<pre>
  DOOM2.BAT
    cd c:\legacydir\
    doomlegacy -game doom2
</pre>

<pre>
  DM8.BAT
    cd c:\legacydir\
    doomlegacy -iwad waddir\doom2.wad -home c:\homedir\ -config c:\homedir\config8.cfg
</pre>

<pre>
  DM2MOD.BAT
    SET HOME=c:\games\home
    SET DOOMWADDIR=c:\games\wads
    cd c:\games\legacydir
    doomlegacy -game doom2 -file levl9.wad mod2.deh mod8.bex
</pre>



<h3>Windows with launcher</h3>
<p>
  The launcher is no longer actively supported, but older launchers will still work.
  Most of the settings that the launcher supports can now be set from the console.
<p>
  The launcher has some problems with setting home and config directories.
  You will likely have to include <br>
  "-config mydir\config.cfg", and/or "-home homedir" in options.
<ul>
  <li>Unpack the archive to a suitable program directory, like C:\legacy</li>
  <li>Start the Launcher</li>
  <li>Fill in required information about WAD locations and hardware options</li>
  <li>Launch the game!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>
<p>
  You can set the following environment variables to
  have additional control over Legacy behavior. None of them are
  required.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The environment variable <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> defines the path where
    the wad files are located. This way you can easily share your wad
    files between different programs.  If it is not defined a default wad
    directory will be checked for existing, and then an alternate directory.
    If none exist, then by default, Legacy looks for wad files in the current directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    The variable <b>USER</b>, containing your username, is used as the
    default value for your player name in multiplayer games.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your home directory is defined by the variable <b>HOME</b>.
    In the home directory DoomLegacy will create a legacy directory to store
    your config and savegame files.
    If this variable is not defined, a default legacy home directory will be
    checked for existing.  If none exist, then by default the current
    directory will be used for home.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up the game</h3>
<p>
  Legacy uses a configuration file (config.cfg) to setup the game.
  Your personal control settings are saved in your config.cfg file.
  They can be changed by menus in Legacy, and are saved when quitting
  the game.
<p>
  When config.cfg does not exist, Legacy will write one using a default config.
</p>
<p>
  OpenGL uses a separate file, 'glconfig.cfg', so that the OpenGL
  settings do not disturb an existing config file. This does
  mean that switching to OpenGL requires setting up the controls again.
<p>
  Develop mode (-devgame or -devparm), will use devdataconfig.cfg as its config file.
</p>

  
<h3>Setting up the controls</h3>
<p>
  Setting up the controls, mouse and joystick, video mode etc. is done
  while in the game, using the main game menus: Setup Controls,
  Video Options, Game Options. You can change all game settings
  at any time during the game.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse will be activated by default, to disable it, change
  the 'use_mouse' variable in the console.
  The joystick will not be used as default, set the 'use_joystick'
  variable at the console.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse and joystick sensitivities can be set
  using the console variables!!!
</p>
  

<h3>Setting up the sound</h3>
The binary downloads of DoomLegacy use SDL sound.  The other options require downloading source code and compiling
with your own selection of compile options.
<ul>
<li>SDL
<p>
  In the SDL version of Legacy the SDL library handles sound. If it
  is installed correctly then Legacy will have sound effects.
<p>
  The latest SDL version is 1.2.14, and it fixes some earlier Win32 issues.
<p>
  Music requires SDL_mixer version 1.2.7 or later. Earlier SDL_mixer
  versions do not have a working RWOPS interface. Legacy can play music
  using files instead, but this requires recompiling Legacy, allowing it
  to detect the SDL_mixer version.
<p>
  SDL_mixer is a separate download and installation, and the latest is version 1.2.11.

</p>
</li>

<li>WINDOWS
<p>
  In the Windows native version the sound is autodetected using DirectX so make sure your card works
  well with DirectX and it legacy will use it.
<p>
  Additionally the Legacy could utilize the hardware 3D sound
  for making more realistic sound environment.
<p>
  Specify -ds3d command line parameter to use generic 3D sound driver
  (DirectSound 3D). This driver are suitable for most 3D sound chips.
<p>
  Some of this support requires that FMOD be installed.
  Some parts of -digmusic support may be currently broken.
</p>
</li>

<li>DOS
<p>
  The sound and music card is auto-detected at the game startup.
<p>
  If you don't get any sound in Legacy, check that the BLASTER
  variable is set. Type 'set' at the dos prompt (or dosbox under
  Windows) : do you see a line like 'BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 ...' ?
  If not, run the installation of your soundcard for Dos mode,
  it will usually modify your autoexec.bat so that the BLASTER
  variable will be set. See the FAQ.TXT for more.
<p>
  If the BLASTER variable is set, but you still don't hear any
  sounds, or the sounds are not right, then edit the SOUND.CFG
  file, and manually set your type of soundcard, see there for
  more.
</p>
</li>
</ul>  

<h3>Setup Controls menu</h3>
<p>
  You can bind actions to one or two keys, like in all decent games.
  Select an action, press ENTER, and then press the desired key,
  mouse button, or joystick button.

  To CLEAR the keys attached to a control, use the BACKSPACE key.
</p>
<p>
  To setup the DOUBLE CLICK for mouse/joystick buttons: enter the
  click one time, so that it displays, e.g. 'MOUSEBUTTON1'. Then
  re-enter the click a second time, and it will transform into a
  dbl-click, e.g. 'MOUSEBUTTON1' will become 'DOUBLEMOUSE1'.

  You can use double-clicks for any joystick/mouse button, and you
  can attach any action to it.
</p>
<p>
  When controlperkey is "Several", a single key can be set to 
  multiple actions, e.g. go backward and 'use' at the same time.
  Normally when a key is set for an action, other uses of the
  same key are cleared.
</p>


<h3 id=gamma>Gamma controls</h3>
<p>
  The control of gamma is much finer than before. The gamma table is
  now generated from the control settings, instead of using
  four preset gamma tables.
</p>
<p>
  The gamma control functions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gamma: Only has a gamma slider</li>
  <li>Gamma_black: Gamma control and black level control.</li>
  <li>Gamma_bright_black: Gamma control, bright control, and black
    level control.</li>
  <li>Linear: Has bright and black level controls, as two set-points
    of piecewise linear brightness correction. It is included
    for use with LCD displays.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Controls for gamma function, black level, bright level, and gamma
  are on an options page. The values can also be changed by a
  console set command, or in your personal config.cfg file.
</p>
<div class="code">gammafunc Gamma_bright_black
black -2
gamma 2
bright -1</div>
<p>
  To see the current setting just type the name, without a value.
  Normal levels are black 0, gamma 0.
</p>
<p>
  To set the gamma correction to your preference,
  find a dark area in a wad or use the gamma.wad file
  (i.e. -file gamma.wad).
  Set the black level to give a good looking even gray scale in the
  darkest areas (little gray room in gamma.wad).
  White textures will not go completely to black, but will instead stay
  gray. The software renderer is limited to 32 light levels, so do not try to
  get it perfect in the darkest three gray test strips as it is not
  possible. Instead try to get the gray intervals even. You should be
  able to just barely see an object right in front of you in the darkest
  room, and see white textures across the room as a dark gray patch.
</p>
<p>
  Then go to a normally lit area and adjust gamma to give the
  brightness and evenness of tone that you would expect.
</p>
<p>
  Use the bright control to adjust the brightest outdoor scenes
  after the gamma and black levels are set. Unlike most monitors,
  this bright control actually controls the brightest light levels.
</p>
<p>
  Your preferences may be different. From experiments, trying too
  hard to set a perfect black leads to extreme gamma settings to correct
  for the side effects. It is a compromise, as actual hardware varies,
  and the gamma table equations represent ideal CRT behavior.
  LCD monitor gamma response is even less ideal.
</p>
<p>
  Evenness is usually more important than absolute brightness. The brightness
  appearance is affected greatly by the amount of light over your monitor.
  If the wall textures look harsh, then the gamma is set too high, or
  the black level is set too low.
</p>

<div class="code">

<h2 id="gameplay">BASIC GAMEPLAY</h2>

<h3>Shooting up and down</h3>
<p>
  There's nothing changed, except of course a totally new
  deathmatch experience.
</p>
<p>
  About the BFG: the BFG ball can be fired up or down, but
  the invisible rays that spray from you have always 'autoaim', they're
  not dependent of your up and down aim.
  Let's be clear: apart from being able
  to shoot the BIG BFG BALL up or down, the side-effect of the BFG
  is as before.
</p>
  
<h3>Autoaim toggle</h3>
<p>
  We wanted to keep the compatibility with the traditional Doom gameplay,
  but we needed also to go forward and bring more depth to the
  deathmatches. One of these steps is enabling manual aiming.
</p>
<p>
  You may feel like it's unbalanced if some people use the autoaim,
  as they don't have to make the effort of aiming properly, and others
  don't use it and do their best to aim up and down...
  NEW since Legacy v1.2: with allowautoaim you can
  disable autoaiming, that is, impose manual aim to all players
  in a network game, use with caution!!
</p>

<h3>Weapon changes</h3>
<p>
  We didn't dare of course change the existing weapons functionality!
  You may appreciate however, the fact that you can remap every
  weapon to any key, in the Setup Controls menu. Since you can map two
  keys per 'control', you can keep the original keys '1'-'8' for the
  weapons, and add a shortcut to your preferred ones. eg: '5' and 'r'
  for rockets.
</p>
  
<h3>New cheats</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>idcd##</dt>
  <dd>
    Similar to the 'idcmus##', but for CD Audio tracks.
    Example: 'idcd02' starts cd track 2.
  </dd>
  <dt>idfly</dt>
  <dd>Fly around levels, using the jump key to gain altitude.</dd>
</dl>

  
<h3>Savegame directories</h3>
<p>
  Legacy allows savegame directories, with up to 99 savegames in each
  directory. This feature can be enabled/disabled by a compile time
  option.
</p>
<p>
  The savegame file names include the level name and play time.
  The savegames also have a human-readable header with this and more
  information, including the command line switches used.
</p>
<p>
  The cursor movement keys are up-arrow, down-arrow, page-up, and page-down.<br/>
  The delete key will delete the selected savegame or directory.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  The savegame menus now include a directory name.
  The directory is selected by moving the cursor up to the directory name,
  and pressing ENTER. The menu will present all the existing directory
  names. The blank directory line is the legacy default directory
  which contains all the directories and savegames.
</p>
<p>
  To create a new directory, move to the directory line, press ENTER,
  type in a new directory name, and press ENTER.
</p>


<h3>OpenGL renderer</h3>
<p>
  Legacy includes two different graphics engines, the old Doom
  software renderer (with many improvements) and an OpenGL-based hardware renderer.
</p>
<p>
  The OpenGL renderer is shinier and has fancier effects than the software one, but
  it does not do everything that the software renderer does.
  It does have coronas, explosion light, and other light effects that the software
  renderer does not do.
<p>
  Some wads rely upon violating wad rules to get trick effects.  These rely upon tricking the software renderer into not drawing something.
  Using those wads with the OpenGL renderer you will see holes in the floor and ceiling, and warning messges
  about polygons.
<p>
  OpenGL relies upon having video card hardware acceleration.
  This requires that your video card drivers support OpenGL operations.
  Without OpenGL hardware acceleration, SDL will emulate the OpenGL operations using software run on your CPU, which is very very slow.
  How well a video card works with OpenGL is dependent upon the drivers.  It is SDL that interfaces with the video card drivers.
<p>
  Video cards have different levels of hardware acceleration, and rendering speed.
  Activate only as many fancy rendering options as your video card can draw fast.
  Turning off Trilinear and Bilinear filtering can gain speed.
</p>


<h2 id="console">CONSOLE</h2>
<p> 
See <a href="console.html">here</a> for more about the console.
</p>

  
<h2 id="network">NETWORK GAMES (MULTIPLAYER)</h2>
<p>  
  Since Legacy 1.2, the network part of Doom has been totally
  rewritten. It now uses a better transfer method for the packets,
  (which is usually faster), and also implements a basic
  Client/Server model, where some critical game options are
  changeable only by the server in multiplayer games.
</p>
<p>
  Since the network communication is faster, we have upped
  the maximum number of players to 32!
</p>


<h3>Client/server model features</h3>
<p>
  The network code has been totally rewritten, here are the
  main features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players can join in while a game is in progress.
    No need to restart the game to add a new player.</li>
  <li>Up to 32 players in a game.</li>
  <li>
    The speed now depends on the server. If the server loses
    frames, all the other players will experience the slow down.
    Thus, make sure that the server runs smooth for example by using a
    lower resolution graphics mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    The server can kick any player out of the game. The player will
    be returned to the title screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consistency failure now only kicks out the player who was not
    'up-to-date', not the others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Critical game variables are sent to all the players when they
    are changed on the server, and only the server can change them.
    Examples are 'allowjump', 'respawnitemtime', 'deathmatch', ...
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  NOTE that there is no 'dedicated' server for now.
</p>


<h3>Setting up a network game</h3>
<p>
  A network game can be started either using the commandline
  parameters -server and -connect, or from the multiplayer menu that
  allows you to connect to a server or create one yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Legacy uses the UDP port 5029 only and can accept messages from any
  port so it works perfectly with NAT (Network Address Translation).

  Because the IP of any computer behind the firewall is not routable 
  the server cannot get a usable IP address during player join-game.
  If you are familiar with IpAutoforward funtionality of Linux,
  you can make a usable IP appear.
</p>

<p>

  * The server types:
  <br>
  <p>Start a server with one of the following server commands.
  One player can play on the server itself. Other switches can also be
  included to select the game and wad.
<br><br>

  &gt; doomlegacy -server &lt;num-of-computers&gt;<br>

  <p>The server will wait until the specified number of computers have
  connected and then will start the game. This is like the old way to
  start a game. It is more fair because all players start at the same
  time and with the same weapons. Of course other computers can also
  join later.
  <br>

  &gt; doomlegacy -server <br>
  <p>This starts the server and does not wait for any computers.
  It starts the game immediately. Other players can join later.
  <br>

  
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>* Clients are the other players who join in the server:<br>
  <p>Each additional player connects to the server with one of the following
   connect commands.
<br><br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -connect &lt;ip address of server&gt;<br>
  <p>Connects to a specific server computer using their ip address.

  <br><br>

  &gt; doomlegacy -connect<br>
  <p>This will auto-detect a server on a LAN. This only works when
  computers are directly connected. If you play through internet,
  the server can NOT be auto-detected, and you must specify it's
  IP address.
<br>
<br>
  
  Example A, 3 players on a LAN:<br>
<br>
  player 1 (the server)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -server 3<br>
<br>
  player 2 (client)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -connect<br>
<br>
  player 3 (client)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -connect<br>
<br>
  Example B, 2 players, through internet:<br>
<br>
  player 1 (the server)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -server 2<br>
<br>
  player 2 (client)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx<br>
<br>
  Example C, a 3 player game, with _TWO_ computers, one is split-screen:<br>
<br>
  player 1 (the server)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -server 3<br>
<br>
  player 2 and 3 (2 clients on the same computer)<br>
  &gt; doomlegacy -splitscreen -connect<br>
<br>
  
  <p>You don't need to put all parameters on the client side like :
  -deathmatch, -warp xx, -respawn, -fast, etc because the server
  automatically sends those to all clients upon connection.

  <p>Also the -file parameter is not needed by the player anymore. The server
  will send the file needed to the client. Let's say rather the client
  can download it from the server. But of course the client will first
  check for the file in the directory or subdirectory.

  <p>Use '-notime' to disable file date check on clients. Normally
  the game will warn you if a client has a file loaded by the
  server, but with a different date. Clients should have the exact
  same version of the files added by the server.

  <p>You want to know some things : you need a good ping value, perfect
  is less than 30, more than this will be very unplayable, because
  there is not, for the moment, code to reduce the latency between
  command entered at keyboard and command execution.

  <p>In other words, Doom Legacy doesn't use 'interpolation' to make
  you believe like the game is 'smooth' when it is not in reality.
</p>
  

<h3>Multiplayer intermission screen</h3>

<ul>
  <li>FRAGS: the usual frags rankings</li>
  <li>
  BUCHHOLZ: a chess scoring system. You earn more points
  when you frag a good player (one that has a lot of frags at the end
  of the game).
  This is more balanced that the original frags system, because
  you can't get a good score simply by slaughtering clueless newbies.
<p>
  If player i has fragged player j F[i][j] times,
  the total frags of player i are given by T[i] = sum_j F[i][j].
  The Buchholz score of player i is sum_j F[i][j] * T[j].
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  INDIVIDUAL: the players are all compared 1 to 1, when a
  player wins he earns 3 points, if they draw they each
  get 1 point. Then all the points are added and the
  winner is the one with the most points. This was
  suggested by Cristian Romero (romero-c@usa.net).
  Is is not perfect, but is already interesting enough:
  think of it more 'individual'. You have to make more frags
  compared to each other player to earn points. So you will
  want to go after players that you can make more frags, and
  forget about the ones which have already too much frags
  compared to you. Go for the victories, more than the frags.
  </li>
  <li>DEATHS: this ranking shows the players who have died the most!</li>
</ul>

  
<h2 id="cmdline">COMMANDLINE OPTIONS</h2>

<p>Here are the command-line options Legacy recognizes:</p>

They will be executed right after the configfile, but before autoexec.cfg.</td>

  <td>-game &lt;game-name&gt;</td>
<td>
  Forces a particular game mode to be used. This replaces renaming
  the wad file. If an IWAD is not explicitly given, the appropriate
  IWAD will be automatically loaded.

  The valid game-name at this time are:

<p>
  Otherwise the default of 24 to 80 MiB is used.
  This and the MIN and MAX limits are set by compile time options.
</p>
<p>
  This sets the number of megabytes of memory to allocate to ZALLOC at
  Doom startup. ZALLOC is used for saving the directories, textures,
  and other lumps of the wad files. Executable and stack use other
  memory.
</p>
<p>
  If the amount of requested memory is not available, then it will try for
  half of what is free.
  There are several compile time options for ZALLOC memory allocation,
  the updated Zone allocation, automatic growing Zone allocation,
  and simple and tagged malloc allocations.
</p>
<p>
  The default memory allocator, GROW_ZONE, will grow the memory allocation
  when needed.
  It is no longer critical to set enough memory on the command line,
  although it may make loading smoother.

<h2 id="notes">NOTES</h2>

  
<h3>DeHackEd patches</h3>
<p>  
  Doom Legacy supports dehacked patches... of course its
  now done a more subtle way: you just specify the dehacked
  patch file at the command prompt, instead of actually patching the
  executable.
</p>
<p>
  You can specify multiple .deh files using the -file option, and they
  will all be executed, in the order you have given them.
  Also, since version 1.30, Legacy will look for a lump named DEHACKED
  in each wad file and treat the contents as a dehacked patch.
</p>
<p>  
  We don't check for the dehacked patch version, we added support for the
  patches version 6, it should run ok with (not too) old patches.
  If you have a problem with the version of the patch, try to convert it.
  Just load the .deh file into a recent version of Dehacked (3.0),
  and then save it again. It will then be saved as a text-file, that
  Legacy will be able to use.
</p>
<p>
  All text changes are supported, you can edit the .deh manually and
  replace strings by larger strings than the original Doom, it works.
  Sprite renaming works too, well, pretty much anything works :)
