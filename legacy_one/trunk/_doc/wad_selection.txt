The new wad selection mechanism
By [WDJ]  March 23, 2010

The following command line switches will force the execution mode:
"-freedoom"	=> GDESC_freedoom
"-freedm"	=> GDESC_freedm
"-doom2"	=> GDESC_doom2
"-freedu"	=> GDESC_freedoom_ultimate
"-doomu"	=> GDESC_ultimate or GDESC_ultimate_se
"-doom1"	=> GDESC_doom_shareware
"-plutonia"	=> GDESC_plutonia
"-tnt"		=> GDESC_tnt
"-blasphem"	=> GDESC_blasphemer
"-heretic"	=> GDESC_heretic
"-heretic1"	=> GDESC_heretic_shareware
"-hexen"	=> GDESC_hexen
"-hexen1"	=> GDESC_hexen_demo
"-chex1"	=> GDESC_chex1
"-ultimode"	=> GDESC_ultimate_mode
"-doommode"	=> GDESC_doom_mode
"-heremode"	=> GDESC_heretic_mode
"-hexemode"	=> GDESC_hexen_mode


The following is the table of recognized games and modes.
The gname is used to tag save games.
The idstr is used to make save game directories, and the selection switch.
The title appears at game start, to identify the wad.
The wad will be checked for having the required lumps.
The execution mode controls Legacy features and game play restrictions.
  D1 shareware = Doom shareware version
  D1 registered = Doom registered version
  UD retail = Ultimate Doom
  DII commercial = DoomII with Boom extensions
  heretic = Heretic inventory etc.
  hexen = Hexen
  chexquest1 = Chex Quest extensions.

Boom extensions and Legacy extensions will be active in all modes except
where a specific mode has incompatibilities.
