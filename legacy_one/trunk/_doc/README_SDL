Linux SDL Doom Legacy 1.40
==========================

This is the first public release of the Linux SDL Version
of Doom Legacy.

Known bugs:
- in windowed mode the mouse can leave the window even if
  mouse is in use
- when entering the window with the mouse the players view
  tilts
- you need to have a libGL.so and libGLU.so installed, even
  if you play with SW rendering - this is not considered a
  bug at the moment, maybe in the future when too many
  users complain :)

You will need SDL-1.2 minimum, SDL_Mixer-1.2 and the timidity
patches.

If you don´t have SDL installed on your system you can use the
SDL libraries that come with Legacy. Just go to the appropriate
directory and type "run-lsdldoom.sh". As SDL is built to ones
system configuration I can not guarantee that these libraries
work for you. If you have any problems with the SDL libs
contained in this package, please go to
http://www.libsdl.org and compile it yourself.
