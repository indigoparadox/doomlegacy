<a name="start"><h4>Getting Started</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get started using FraggleScript in your DOOM
levels, you'll need to fully understand most or all aspects of DOOM level
editing and WAD file manipulation. If you haven't mastered this basic stuff,
it would probably be wise to check out the Doomworld tutorials section and to
look up a few FAQs. These documents assume you understand basic DOOM editing.

<p>
When you first want to create scripts, you should save a blank file from a
suitable text editor as something appropriate, like "map01.fs"  The .fs
extension is not required, but its useful for figuring out what and where your
files are later.<br>
When you have the file, you need to place a header in it like this:
<pre>
[scripts]
</pre>
This tells the game that your mapinfo is declaring a section for scripts. Note
that FraggleScript scripts in Legacy reside in the map header along with all
other mapinfo information. If you want to define other mapinfo blocks, you can
put them before or after this section.<br>
Example:
<pre>
[level info]
levelname = The Palace of w00t
creator = Quasar

[scripts]
</pre>

After the header is in place you can begin defining scripts and variables.
When your job is done, you can use the add_fs utility, available with Legacy, 
to insert your scripts into the level. How to define and use scripts is
covered below.
<br><br>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="scripts"><h4>Defining Scripts</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripts are the basic subprogram unit of
FraggleScript, similar to the functions of C and the procedures of Pascal.
FraggleScript scripts do not take any explicit parameters, however, and
cannot return values, which is quite different from most languages.<br>
Levels can currently have up to 256 scripts, numbered from 0 to 255 (future
expansion of this number is possible to allow for persistent scripts). Scripts
exist only within the level to which they belong, and for the most part only
affect that level, with the exception of hub variables.<br>
To declare a script, follow the syntax of the following example:
<pre>
[scripts]

script 0
{
}
</pre>
The <span class="keyword">script</span> keyword denotes that the script definition is starting, and the number
following it is the number for this script. Script numbers should always be
unique, one per defined script.<br><br>

The script above is valid, but it is not very interesting because it does
nothing, and a script alone cannot run without first being called. Scripts may
be invoked in several manners, which is covered in the Script Activation
Models section.<br><br>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="vars"><h4>Variables and Data Types</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way in which scripts can accomplish things is
to interact with variables. Variables can be of three natures, explained as
follows:<br><br>

Built-In -- These variables are always present and are defined by the 
FraggleScript runtime. They can be accessed by any script. Their value typically
defaults at the beginning of each level.<br><br>

Built-in variables, current to Legacy 1.40, include:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> consoleplayer - the player number, 0 to 3 
inclusive, of the player attached to the local machine<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> displayplayer - the player number of the player 
being displayed on the local machine<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> zoom - the zoom level for the game camera<br><br>

<span class="keyword">mobj</span> trigger - a reference to the mapthing that
started this script. This variable is important and very useful.<br><br>

Global -- These variables are defined outside of any script, either in a header
file or in the [scripts] section of the mapinfo lump. Any scripts in the current
level can access these types of variables. If global variables are declared with
the <span class="keyword">const</span> keyword, they are constants, and if they are 
declared with the <span class="keyword">hub</span> keyword, then the current list 
of hub variables will be searched by name for a match when the declaration is encountered. 
Hub global variables persist between levels and can be accessed and modified by 
scripts in any level until the current cluster ends.<br><br>

Examples:
<pre>
[scripts]

const DOORSPEED = 4;
hub int visitedSwamp = 0;

int i = 0;

script 0
{
   i = i + 1;
}
</pre>

Note that const variables adapt to the default type for their provided literal,
while hub global variables require explicit typing.<br><br>

Local -- These variables are declared inside a script. They can only be accessed
within the script itself, and are destroyed when the script completes execution.
<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
[scripts]

int i = 0;

script 0
{
   int i = 1;
   print(i);
}
</pre>

Note that the print function in this example will print the string "1" and not
"0" because local variables always take precedence over any built-in or global
variables. This is an important distinction to remember.<br><br>

Variable names may be of arbitrary length, but should not be named with any
FraggleScript reserved word.<br><br>

FraggleScript has four primary data types as follows:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> - 
32-bit signed integer. Only decimal integer literals are accepted.<br><br>
Example:
<pre>
int x = 0;
</pre>

<span class="keyword">fixed</span> (also <span class="keyword">float</span>) - 
a 32-bit fixed-point number, somewhat similar to floating-point except that the 
decimal place is fixed at 16 bits so that the word is evenly divided into 
integer and decimal parts. fixed numbers must be specified with a decimal point, 
otherwise the literal will be interpreted as an integer. fixed values are used 
for high precision interaction with the game world.<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
fixed f = 2.71828;
</pre>

<span class="keyword">string</span> - a string of ASCII characters. 
FraggleScript strings are limited in length to 256 characters. The following 
escape sequences are supported:<br><br>

\n - line break<br>
\\ - a literal \ character<br>
\" - a literal " character<br>
\? - a literal ? character<br>
\a - bell character - causes the console to play a sound<br>
\t - tab<br>
\0 - write white text

Strings must be delimited by quotation marks as follows:<br><br>
<pre>
"Hello, World!\n"
</pre>

<span class="keyword">mobj</span> - an opaque reference to a DOOM mapthing 
(ie monster, lamp, fireball, player). The values of these references must either 
be obtained from object spawning functions, or can be specified by use of 
integer literals, in which case the mobj reference will point to the mapthing 
numbered by the map editor with that number<br><br>

Examples:
<pre>
// spawn a new dwarf and keep a reference to it in "dwarf"
mobj dwarf = spawn(HALIF, 0, 0, 0);

// get a reference to the thing numbered 0 at map startup
mobj firstthing = 0;
</pre>

Note that using map editor numbers for things has the distinct disadvantage
that when the map is edited, the things will be automatically renumbered if any
are deleted. It is suggested that the latter form of mobj
reference assignment be avoided unless necessary.<br><br>

mobj references are very powerful and allow a large number of effects and
fine control not available in other languages such as ACS.<br><br>

Also note that although integer literals can be used to assign mobj reference
values, mobj and int are not interchangeable, and statements such as
<pre>
mobj halif2 = halif + firstthing;
</pre>
are not, in general, meaningful.<br><br>

<a name="coercions"><h5>Type Coercions</h5></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FraggleScript is a weakly typed language, and
as such, coercions are made freely between all data types. These coercions
follow the rules below:<br><br>

Conversion to <span class="keyword">int</span> from:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">string</span> - the string will be passed to the ANSI C function atoi()<br><br>
<span class="keyword">fixed</span> - the fixed-point value will be chopped to its integer portion with no rounding<br><br>
<span class="keyword">mobj</span> - coercion is not meaningful, -1 is always returned
<br><br>

Conversion to <span class="keyword">fixed</span> from:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">string</span> - the string will be passed to the ANSI C function atof(), and then the
resulting double value is renormalized and chopped into fixed precision (this
process incurs unavoidable round-off error).<br><br>
<span class="keyword">int</span> - the integer value is renormalized as a fixed value (overflow is possible if
the integer is greater than 32767 or less than -32768, and is not checked).<br><br>
<span class="keyword">mobj</span> - coercion is not meaningful, -1*FRACUNIT is returned (FRACUNIT is equal to
1<<16 and represents the value 1 in the fixed-point number system).
<br><br>

Conversion to <span class="keyword">string</span> from:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> - the value is converted to a string via the rules of ANSI C's stdio functions<br><br>
<span class="keyword">fixed</span> - the value is renormalized as an IEEE double floating-point number and then
converted to string via the rules of ANSI C's stdio functions (this process incurs
some unavoidable round-off error)<br><br>
<span class="keyword">mobj</span> - coercion is not meaningful, the string "map object" is always returned
<br><br>

Conversion to <span class="keyword">mobj</span> from:<br><br>

<span class="keyword">int</span> - the level is checked for a mapthing numbered by the value of this integer
and if it exists, a reference to it is returned -- if it does not exist, a script
error will occur<br><br>
<span class="keyword">string</span> - the string will be passed to atoi() and the resulting integer value will
be cast via the rules above<br><br>
<span class="keyword">fixed</span> - the fixed value is chopped to its integer portion and then the resulting
integer value will be cast via the rules above
<br><br>

Coercion is an automatic process that takes place when a variable is assigned the
value of a variable of a different type, when values are passed to functions
that do not match the specified parameter types, and when operands of multiple
types are used with some operators. Some functions may perform more strict type 
checking at their own volition, so beware that script errors may occur if 
meaningless values are passed to some functions.<br><br>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="functions"><h4>Calling Functions</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FraggleScript offers an extensible host of built-in
functions that are implemented in native code. They are the primary means to 
manipulate the game and cause things to happen. The FraggleScript Function
Reference is a definitive guide to all functions supported by the Legacy dialect;
this document will provide some basic examples of function use.<br><br>

Most functions accept a certain number of parameters and expect them to represent
values of specific meaning, such as an integer representing a sector tag, or
an mobj reference to a mapthing to affect.<br><br>

The function reference lists the parameters that each function expects, but
there are some important things to take note of. As mentioned in the previous
section, type coercions can occur when functions are passed parameters of other
types. An excellent example is the following:

<pre>
script 0
{
   startscript("1");
}
</pre>

The startscript function expects an integer value corresponding to the number
of a script to run. Here it has been passed a string, "1". Strings will be
converted to the integer they represent, if possible, so this string is
automatically coerced into the integer value 1, and the script 1 will be started.
<br><br>

An example of a coercion that is NOT meaningful in the intended manner would be
the following:

<pre>
script 0
{
   mobj halif = 0;
   
   startscript(halif);
}
</pre>

mobj references can be assigned using integer literals, but the rules for
coercion from mobj to int state that -1 is always returned for an mobj value
(this is because there is *not* a one-to-one mapping between mobj references,
which can include objects spawned after map startup which do not have a number,
and integers). This statement has the effect of
<pre>
startscript(-1);
</pre>
and since -1 is not in the domain of startscript, a script error occurs.<br><br>

Parameter coercions of this type should be avoided for purposes of clarity and 
maintainability of your code. When coercions are convenient or necessary, be
certain that the value you obtain through coercion will always be meaningful.
<br><br>

Note that some functions, like print, can take a variable number of parameters.
These types of functions generally treat all their parameters in a like manner,
and can accept up to 128 of them. See the reference to get a better idea about
these types of functions and what they do.<br><br>

Functions may return values, and in fact, most useful functions do. To capture
the return value of a function, you simply assign it to a variable.<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
script 0
{
   fixed dist;
   
   dist = pointtodist(0, 0, 1, 1);
}
</pre>
This places the fixed-point distance between the points (0,0) and (1,1) into
the fixed variable dist. It is *not* necessary to capture the return value of
a function simply because it has one. For instance,
<pre>
script 0
{
   pointtodist(0, 0, 1, 1);
}
</pre>
is a valid statement; it is simply useless since pointtodist has no side
effects, or things that occur within a function call that affect the program 
environment. Likewise, it is possible to use function return values without
explicitly capturing them in variables, like in the following example:
<pre>
script 0
{
   print(spawn(IMP, 0, 0, 0));
}
</pre>
This causes a new imp to be spawned at (0,0,0), a side effect. Since spawn
additionally returns a reference to the new object, the mobj reference returned
by spawn becomes the parameter to the print function, and the resulting output
to the console is "map object". The value returned by spawn "disappears" after
the print function has executed and cannot be retrieved or otherwise used. This
is useful when you don't need to save the return value of a function beyond
using it as a parameter.<br><br>

If a function is listed as being of return type void, this means that it does
not return a meaningful value and that it operates by side effect only, like
a procedure in some languages. However, unlike in C, void functions in 
FraggleScript, will return the integer value 0, rather than causing an error 
when used in assignments. In practice, it is best not to assign variables the 
null return value from a void  function even though it is allowed, since this 
is confusing to see in code and useless anyways.<br><br>

Note that it is possible to make limited function calls outside of any script,
in the surrounding program environment, which in FraggleScript is referred to
as the levelscript. Function calls placed in the levelscript will be executed
once (and only once) at the beginning of the level. This is commonly used to
start scripts to perform certain actions.<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
[scripts]

script 0
{
   message("Welcome to the Palace of w00t, foolish mortals!");
}

startscript(0);

</pre>

In this example, all players would see this message at the beginning of the
level. It is not required, but is good style, to put any levelscript function
calls after all script definitions.<br><br>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="control"><h4>Control Flow Structures</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control flow structures allow your code to make
decisions and repeat actions over and over. There are several basic control
structures, and each are covered here in full.<br><br>

<span class="keyword">while</span><br><br>

The while loop is the basic loop control structure. It will continually loop
through its statements until its condition evaluates to 0, or false.<br><br>

Basic syntax:
<pre>
while(&lt;condition&gt;)
{
   &lt;statements&gt;
}
</pre>

Unlike in C, the braces are required to surround the block statement of a while
loop, even if it only contains one statement. An operative example would be the
following:

<pre>
script 0
{
   int i = 0;
   while(i < 10)
   {
      print(i, "\n");
      i = i + 1;
   }
}
</pre>

This code would print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.<br><br>

The continue() and break() functions are capable of modifying the behavior of
the while loop. continue() causes the loop to return to the beginning and run
the next iteration, while break() causes the loop to exit completely, returning
control to the surrounding script.<br><br>

A while loop can run forever if its condition is never false, but if you write
a loop like this, be sure to call one of the wait functions inside the body of
the loop, or else the game will wait on the script to finish forever, effectively
forcing you to reboot!<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
script 0
{
   while(1)
   {
      if(rnd() < 24)
      {
         ambientsound("dsbells");
      }
      wait(20);
   }
}
</pre>

This is additionally a fine example of how to do ambient sounds with 
FraggleScript.<br><br>

<span class="keyword">for</span><br><br>

The for loop is a more sophisticated loop structure that takes three parameters.
Note that unlike C, the FraggleScript for parameters are separated by commas, not
by semicolons, and all 3 are required to be present.<br><br>

Basic syntax:
<pre>
for(&lt;initialization&gt;, &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;iteration&gt;)
{
   &lt;statements&gt;
}
</pre>

All three statments may be of any valid form, although typically the initialization
statement sets a variable to an initial value, the condition statement checks
that that variable is within a certain bound, and the iteration statement 
increments the variable by a certain amount.<br><br>

Braces are again required, and the continue() and break() statements work the
same way here as they do for while(), with the exception that a continuing
for loop will check its condition and perform its iteration, whereas a while
loop ignorantly repeats.<br><br>

An operative example:
<pre>
script 0
{
   int i;
   
   for(i=0, i<10, i=i+1)
   {
      print(i, "\n");
   }
}
</pre>

This for loop is equivalent to the while loop example above. while and for
are logically equivalent in general, for simply provides a cleaner way to 
specify the exact loop behavior. for is a rather complex statement form, so
if this explanation is insufficient, any decent reference on the C language
should have more information that is applicable.<br><br>

<span class="keyword">if</span>, <span class="keyword">elseif</span>,
<span class="keyword">else</span><br><br>

if tests its condition, and if the condition evaluates to any non-zero value,
or true, the statements inside its body are executed. Note that unlike while
and for, braces are not required for an if statement UNLESS you either intend
for the if body to contain more than one statement, OR you intend to place an
elseif or else clause after the if.<br><br>

Basic syntax:
<pre>
if(&lt;condition&gt;)
  &lt;statement&gt;
  
if(&lt;condition&gt;)
{
   &lt;statements&gt;
}
</pre>

Examples:
<pre>
if(i > 10)
  return();
</pre>

<pre>  
if(i)
{   
   print(i, "\n");
   return();
}
</pre>

elseif and else are ancilliary clauses that execute when their corresponding
if statement was not true. elseif tests its own additional condition, and if
it is false, control passes to the next elseif or else, if one exists. An if
can have any number of elseif clauses, and one else clause following it. If 
there is an else clause, it must always be last. When the if statement
evaluates to true, no elseif or else clauses will be executed.<br><br>

Example:
<pre>
script 0
{
   int i = rnd()%10;
   
   if(i == 1)
   {
      spawn(IMP, 0, 0, 0);
   }
   elseif(i <= 5)
   {
      spawn(DEMON, 0, 0, 0);
   }
   else
   {
      spawn(BARON, 0, 0, 0);
   }
}
</pre>

This example, as you should expect, spawns one enemy at (0,0,0), its type 
depending on what random value i was assigned.<br><br>

Note that elseif and else are new to the Eternity and DOOM Legacy dialects of
FraggleScript and that they are not currently supported by SMMU.<br><br>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="activation"><h4>Script Activation Models</h4></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script activation models are simply the different
ways in which scripts can be started.<br><br>

Currently supported activation models include the following:
<ul>
  <li> startscript function<br><br>
  
       Used to start scripts from within FraggleScript code. There are two
       possible uses of this function. If used from the outer context, the
       script will be started automatically at the beginning of the level, and
       player 0 will be used as the trigger object. If used from inside another
       script, the current script's trigger object will propagate to the new
       script.<br><br>
  
  <li> StartScript codepointer<br><br>
  
       Used to start scripts from mapthing frames, this method relies on and
       interacts with DeHackEd editing. To use this method, use a BEX codepointer
       block to place the StartScript pointer into a thing's frame, and then set
       the frame's "Unknown 1" field to the script number to call. The thing 
       whose frame called the codepointer becomes the trigger object. This allows 
       the user to program their own custom codepointer effects in FraggleScript.
       <br><br>
  
  <li> linedef activation<br><br>
  
       A host of new linedef types are provided to allow activation of scripts
       from within levels:
       <ul>
         <li> 272  WR  Start script with tag number
         <li> 273  WR  Start script, 1-way trigger
         <li> 274  W1  Start script with tag number
         <li> 275  W1  Start script, 1-way trigger
         <li> 276  SR  Start script with tag number
         <li> 277  S1  Start script with tag number
         <li> 278  GR  Start script with tag number
         <li> 279  G1  Start script with tag number
       </ul>
       <br>
       To use these lines, simply give them the appropriate type and set the
       linedef's tag number to the script number you want to be called. The
       trigger object will be set to the object that activated the line.<br><br>
</ul>

<a class="eng" href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<p>
<a name="operators"><h4>Operators and Operator Precedence</h4></a>

The Legacy dialect of FraggleScript supports the following operators, in
order of precedence from greatest to least. All operators except = are evaluated
from left to right.

<ul>
  <li> . <br><br>
       Coercions: none<br><br>
       
       The structure operator - can be used to beautify function calls by
       moving the first argument outside the parameter list<br>
       Example:
       <pre>
       script 0
       {
          mobj halif = spawn(DWARF, 0, 0, 0);
          halif.kill();
       }
       </pre>
       This gives FraggleScript a comfortable object-oriented appearance.<br><br>
  
  <li> -- <br><br>
       Coercions: string -> int, mobj -> int<br><br>
  
       The decrement operator - use to lower the value of the operand by 1 -
       if the operator occurs before the operand as a prefix, then the operation
       is performed first before the value can be used, but if it is used as
       a postfix operator, the variable's current value is propagated, and then
       the decrement occurs.<br><br>
      
  <li> ++ <br><br>
       Coercions: string -> int, mobj -> int<br><br>
       
       The increment operator - similar to decrement, but increases the variable's
       value by 1.<br><br>
  
  <li> ! <br><br>
       Coercions: all -> int<br><br>
       
       The logical invert operator. Returns 1 if the operand has an integer 
       value of 0, and 0 otherwise.<br><br>
       
  <li> ~ <br><br>
       Coercions: all -> int<br><br>
       
       The binary invert operator. Reverses all bits in the operand's integer
       value (ie 10101 becomes 01010)<br><br>
       
  <li> % <br><br>
       Coercions: (all*all) -> (int*int)<br><br>
       
       The modulus operator. Returns the remainder when its first operand is
       divided by its second.<br><br>
       
  <li> / <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The division operator. Returns the quotient of the first operand divided
       by the second. Note that if either operand is of type fixed, the other
       operand is coerced to type fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> * <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The multiplication operator. Returns the product of its operands. Note
       that if either operand is of type fixed, the other operand is coerced to
       type fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> - <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The subtraction and unary minus operators. Returns the difference of
       its operands. FraggleScript treats both subtraction and unary minus 
       signs the same; an expression such as -1 is evaluated as if it were 0-1. 
       If either operand is of type fixed, the other operand is coerced to type 
       fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> + <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (string*string), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The addition operator. Returns the sum of its operands. If either operand
       is of type fixed, the other operand will be coerced to type fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> &gt;= <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The logical greater than or equal operator. Returns 1 if its first operand
       is greater than or equal to its second, and 0 otherwise.<br><br>
       
  <li> &lt;= <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The logical less than or equal operator. Returns 1 if its first operand
       is less than or equal to its second, and 0 otherwise.<br><br>
       
  <li> &gt; <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The logical greather than operator. Returns 1 if its first operand is
       greater than its second, and 0 otherwise.<br><br>
       
  <li> &lt; <br><br>
       Coercions: (string*all) -> (int*int), (mobj*all) -> (int*int),
        (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
        
       The logical less than operator. Returns 1 if its first operand is
       less than its second, and 0 otherwise.<br><br>
       
  <li> != <br><br>
       Coercions: (mobj*all) -> (int*int), (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
       
       The logical nonequality operator. For strings, this operator tests against
       string equality, and for numeric types, it tests against numeric
       equality. If either operand is of type fixed, the other operand will be
       coerced to type fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> == <br><br>
       Coercions: (mobj*all) -> (int*int), (fixed*all) -> (fixed*fixed)<br><br>
       
       The logical equality operator. For strings, this operator tests for string
       equality, and for numeric types, it tests for numeric equality. If either
       operand is of type fixed, the other operand will be coerced to type
       fixed.<br><br>
       
  <li> & <br><br>
       Coercions: (all*all) -> (int*int)<br><br>
       
       The binary and operator. This operator sets all bits in its result that
       are set in both of its operands (ie 111010 & 100110 = 100010)<br><br>
       
  <li> | <br><br>
       Coercions: (all*all) -> (int*int)<br><br>
       
       The binary or operator. This operator sets all bits in its result that
       are set in either of its operands (ie 111010 | 100110 = 111110)<br><br>
       
  <li> && <br><br>
       Coercions: (all*all) -> (int*int)<br><br>
       
       The logical and operator. This operator returns 1 if both its operands
       evaluate to 1, and 0 otherwise. If the first operand evaluates to 0, this
       operator will short-circuit without testing the second operand.<br><br>
       
  <li> || <br><br>
       Coercions: (all*all) -> (int*int)<br><br>
       
       The logical or operator. This operator returns 1 if either of its operands
       evaluate to 1, and 0 otherwise. If the first operand evaluates to 1, this
       operator will short-circuit without testing the second operand.<br><br>
       
  <li> = <br><br>
       Coercions: coerces type of expression into type of variable<br><br>
       
       The assignment operator. This operator sets the variable on its left to
       the value of the expression on its right. All other evaluations are
       performed before an assignment takes place.<br><br>

<a name="keywords"><h4>Keyword List</h4></a>

This is a short alphabetical list of keywords in FraggleScript. Variables cannot
be named these words because they are reserved.<br><br>

const<br>
else<br> 
elseif<br>
fixed<br>
float<br>
for<br>
hub<br>
if<br> 
int<br>
mobj<br>
script<br> 
string<br>
while<br><br>

Remember that break, continue, return, and goto are defined as special functions,
and not as keywords.
<br><br>

While the names of functions are not reserved words in the strictest sense,
you should additionally avoid naming variables with the same name as functions
since these variables will hide the functions and make them inaccessible. This
will cause parse errors if you attempt to use the function after declaring a 
variable with the same name.
