   I get the error "Error: W_GetNumForName: STBAR not found!"
   What is it?
  </dt>
  <dd>
   You have an old version of doom.wad. Just upgrade your version to 1.9.
   You can find a patch on the id Software site.
  </dd>

  <dt>
   The game does not look the same as other versions of Doom.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Doom Legacy is an advanced port with many new features.  These features
   offer improved and alternative behaviors over previous versions and other
   ports.
   The controls to select your preferred behavior for these features are
   in the <b>options menu</b>.  Your settings will be saved to your config
   file when you exit the game.  These features can also be controlled
   by setting variables using the console.
   However, if you're looking for the 100% authentic 1990s Doom experience, you
   could try <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>.

<h2><a name="input">Mouse/Joystick/Keyboard</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>My mouse/joystick does not work.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
   First, check that the mouse/joystick is activated : go at the
   console and type either 'use_mouse' (or use the respective
   menuitem) or 'use_joystick'.
   If it is '0' or off then that mouse/joystick is disabled.
   Set the variable to 1. eg: 'use_mouse 1'.
    </p>
    <p>
   Once the mouse or joystick is activated, you have to
   bind the buttons to controls in the <b>setup controls menu</b>.

<h2><a name="video">Video</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt>The game doesn't restore the video mode I have chosen the last time
   I played Doom Legacy.</dt>
  <dd>
   The current video mode has to be made the 'default' so that it is
   saved to the config: press the key 'd' on the Video Options menu
   to set the current video mode the default.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>The game display is sideways.</dt>
  <dd>
   Some monitors can be tilted to be tall, for working with documents.
   They have display modes like 800x600, and 600x800.
   They can detect 600x800 (where the 800 is the height), assume the
   tilted mode, and display the raster accordingly.  Other tilt monitors
   may sense the tilted mode with a switch instead.
   Use the 800x600 video mode instead.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>The game display proportions are wrong.</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
   The original Doom graphics were designed for a 320x200 VGA display with
   a 4:3 physical aspect ratio. Consequently the pixels on these displays had a 5:6
   physical aspect ratio, unlike most modern displays which have
   square pixels. This makes rendering the graphics on modern displays
   somewhat complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The menus and intermission screens are scaled at integer ratios to
   fit the screen.  This will often leave bars at the edges.  Because
   these are drawn using color palette graphics from the wad, attempts
   at finer interpolation required looking up blended colors in a palette
   which lead to a muddy look.  Because of this the menus will be
   larger or smaller for some video display modes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The game rendering is fully scaled to display the same view at
   all video display modes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In software render mode, Doom Legacy will proportion the display to keep
   the original display appearance.  It will display with filler bars if
   necessary to do this.  The pixels will not be identical
   to those from the original Doom.
  </p>
  <p>
   In OpenGL mode using fullscreen, the introduction and intermission pictures
   are stretched to fill the screen.  This does not keep the original aspect ratio.
   The game rendering is adjusted to approximate the 320x200 screen
   size, and the field of view of the original software renderer, assuming the
   display is 4:3.
   There is a FOV control, but it zooms and does not change the aspect
   ratio.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you have a 16:9 display, Doom Legacy displays expecting a 4:3
   aspect, and the monitor will stretch it to the 16:9 shape.  This will alter
   the appearance of rooms and sprites.  Some monitors can be set to
   display a 4:3 aspect with black borders.
   The best alternative is to turn off fullscreen, and choose a window size
   that fills most of the screen.

<dl>
  <dt>The music volume control is not independent of the sound effects
  volume control.
  </dt>
  <dd>
  More recent Windows products changed the sound interface to implement
  only one volume control for a program.  All the Doom ports are
  having problems with this.  Doom Legacy has not implemented any of
  the suggested solutions yet.  One requires starting an independent task to
  play the music, just to get the independent volume control.
