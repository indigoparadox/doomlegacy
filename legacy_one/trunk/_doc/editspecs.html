Section 1: New linedef types.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<strong>1 to 141 &nbsp&nbsp REG</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Original Doom and Doom2 linedef types <br>
<strong>142 to 260 &nbsp BOOM</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Boom extension linedef types <br>
<br>
<h3>New colormap types</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>280 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Legacy water in tagged<br>
<p>
Creates swimmable water in all tagged sectors, with colormap transfer like Boom 242.<br>
</p>
<p>
Similar to the Boom 242 deep water type but swimmable
(using the Legacy swimming code).
It operates more like water than 242 does, but does not have ripples like types 301 and 304.
Unlike type 242, this type will not make the actual floor or ceiling into invisible barriers.<br>
The water is only shown if it is above the target sector's floor;
otherwise, the regular floor is rendered.
When water is rendered, the properties for the top of the water "plane" and the
bottom, are both taken from the control sector's floor.<br>
</p>
<p>
The lightlevel of the water is controlled by the target sector's
lightlevel unless the target sector has been also tagged to a
"Transfer floor properties" linedef, in which case, the water will have
the transfered lightlevel.<br>
It also uses the sidedef1 upper, lower, and middle textures as colormaps
in the targeted sector.
</p>
<p>
It will also create a low fake ceiling if the control ceiling is
lower than the target ceiling (this is usually not desired).<br>
</p>
<p>
The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the top of the water, both sides.<br>
The water is swimmable everywhere below the control sector floor.<br>
The sides of the water display HOM looking inward. <br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are rendered, if they are lower
than the actual ceiling.<br>
</p>
<p>
Under water, the lightlevel is from the control sector, and if the control sector
lower texture defines a colormap, it is used.<br>
Above water, the lightlevel is from the target sector, and if the control sector
middle texture defines a colormap, it is used.<br>
Above the fake ceiling, the lightlevel is from the control sector, and if the control sector
upper texture defines a colormap, it is used.<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<strong>282 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy generate colormap<br>
<p>
This type sets the colormap of all tagged sectors like described below, without changing the floor/ceiling or light values. This is nice for putting colored lighting in many different sectors of different floor/ceiling heights:<br><br>
</p>
<dl>
<dt>uppertexture: #xxxxxxy</dt>
<dd>xxxxxx = 6 hex chars giving the color value in RGB format of the colormap mask<br>
y = 1 alphanumeric char (a-z) denoting the amount of the colormap mask.<br>
</dd>
<br>

<dt>midtexture: #abbcc<br>(not yet supported in hardware mode)</dt>
<dd>a = boolean value (0 or 1) denoting if this particular colormap should be treated like fog (i.e. equal application of colormap to all walls, etc)<br>
bb = numerical value (0 through 32) of the colormap at which the fade begins<br>
cc = numerical value (1 through 33) of the colormap at which the destination color will be reached.<br>
</dd>
<br>

<dt>lowertexture: #xxxxxx<br>(not yet supported in hardware mode)</dt>
<dd>xxxxxx = 6 hex chars denoting the color to which the colormap will fade.<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Translucent linedefs</h3><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>283 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLegacy fog sheet<br>
<p>
Displays a 128 high transparent dark fog texture as the middle texture.
This can be used to make a better fog effect by patching up the "holes" in
fog sectors. Because you often will not want this effect on both sides
of the line, this linedef will only affect sides with a middle texture.<br>
Like other transparent textures, the offset_y must be set to position it vertically.<br>
For ground fog, set offset_y = (fog_height - ceiling_height), which should be negative.<br>
For ceiling smoke, set offset_y = (128 + smoke_bottom - ceiling_height).<br>
</p>
<br>

The old linedef codes for line translucency have been taken by Boom support, so I have shifted the types.<br>
<strong>284 -  LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBrightens everything behind the line. Turns things kinda green though<br>
<strong>285 -  LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLess brightness with allot less green.<br>
<strong>286 -  LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDarkens a little with no green tint.<br>
<strong>287 -  LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBrightens but with no green tint.<br>
<strong>288 -  LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSelective translucency. Only certain colors are translucent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>3dfloor types</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>281 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy solid 3D floor with shadow in tagged<br>
<p>
Creates a solid 3D floor in all tagged sectors.<br>
It creates a floor, as a solid slab with thickness, that can be walked on
 and under.
The slab will conform to the shape of the target sector creating a 3D floor.
</p>
<p>
The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are used for the top of the slab.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the bottom of the slab.<br>
The middle texture of sidedef1 is used for the texture along the sides.<br>
</p>
<p>
The lightlevel and colormap under the 3D floor is changed to the lightlevel
and colormap of the control sector.  This can be used to create a shadow,
or to set a different light level, or to impose a different
colormap under the floor slab.
The edges of the floor slab are lit by whatever colormap and lightlevel exists in the
bordering sector.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, SOLID, RENDERALL, CUTLEVEL <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>289 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy solid 3D floor without shadow in tagged<br>
</p>
<p>
  Creates a solid 3D floor in all tagged sectors, same as type 281, but without changing the lighting under the floor slab.
  The floor does not cast a shadow, so the light below the slab is the same as above.
</p>
<p>
It puts a floor, as a solid slab with thickness, that can be walked on
 and under, inside all tagged sectors.
</p>
<p>
The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are used for the top of the slab.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the bottom of the slab.<br>
The middle texture of sidedef1 is used for the texture along the sides.<br>
</p>
<p>
The edges of the floor slab are lit by whatever colormap and lightlevel exists in the
bordering sector.<br>
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, SOLID, RENDERALL, CUTLEVEL, NOSHADE <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>300 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy solid translucent 3D floor in tagged<br>
<p>
Creates a solid translucent 3D floor in all tagged sectors, same as type 281, but translucent, and without changing
the lighting under the floor slab.<br>
</p>
<p>
It creates a floor, as a solid slab with thickness, that can be walked on
and under.
</p>
<dl>
Sidedef1<br>
<dt>upper texture:    #nnn</dt>
<dd> nnn = 3 digit number that encodes for the translucent effect alpha.
  If it is empty then alpha is 127.<br>
 </dd>
<br>
<dt> middle texture:</dt>
<dd>The middle texture is used for the slab sides, and is displayed translucent.<br>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are used for the top of the slab.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the bottom of the slab.<br>
The middle texture of sidedef1 is used for the texture along the sides.<br>
</p>
<p>
The edges of the floor slab are lit by whatever colormap and lightlevel exists in the
bordering sector.</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, SOLID, RENDERALL, NOSHADE, TRANSLUCENT, EXTRA, CUTEXTRA <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>301 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy translucent 3D water in tagged<br>
</p>
<p>
  Creates translucent 3D water in all tagged sectors.<br>
  Set the control sector ceiling to the water top level, and the floor to the floor level (or below).<br>
</p>
<dl>
Sidedef1<br>
<dt>upper texture:    #nnn</dt>
<dd> nnn = 3 digit number that encodes for the translucent effect alpha.
  If it is empty then alpha is 127.<br>
 </dd>
<br>
<dt> middle texture:</dt>
<dd>The middle texture is used for the water sides, and is displayed translucent.
  Use of a normal texture is recommended for the water sides.
  If a transparent texture, like midspace is used, then there is still a "medusa" effect slowdown. <br>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Used as a floor slab, it is swimmable, and will support the player for as long as they swim.  If they
stop they sink through and fall out the bottom.  The player can walk under the water floor normally.
</p>
<p>
The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are used for the top of the slab.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the bottom of the slab.<br>
The middle texture of sidedef1 is used for the texture along the sides.<br>
</p>
<p>
The lightlevel and colormap within the water is the lightlevel
and colormap of the control sector.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, RENDERALL, TRANSLUCENT, SWIMMABLE, BOTHPLANES, ALLSIDES,
    DOUBLESHADOW, EXTRA, CUTEXTRA, CUTSPRITES <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>304 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy opaque water in tagged <br>
<p>
  Creates a 3D fluid, that is not translucent on the surface.  Within the
  fluid it is transparent.<br>
  Does not have translucent effect, does not have alpha, so upper texture is normal.
</p>
<p>
The control sector is sidedef1 of the linedef.<br>
The control sector ceiling height and texture are used for the top of the slab.<br>
The control sector floor height and texture are used for the bottom of the slab.<br>
The middle texture of sidedef1 is used for the texture along the sides.<br>
</p>
<p>
The lightlevel and colormap within the water is the lightlevel
and colormap of the control sector.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, RENDERALL, SWIMMABLE, BOTHPLANES, ALLSIDES,
  DOUBLESHADOW, EXTRA, CUTEXTRA, CUTSPRITES <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>302 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy 3D fog in tagged<br>
<p>
  Creates 3D fog (using control sector's colormap) in all tagged sectors.<br>
  The middle texture is normal, but is not used.  Has the same light effect as 303, but
  also tints anything seen through any of the edges, top, or bottom, like a translucent.
Because the fog effect is not present within the fog itself, it helps to add some fog sheet
linedefs (283).<br>
</p>
<p>
  For ground fog, set the control ceiling at the fog level, and the
  control floor at floor level.  Set the control sector darker than the
  target sector light level.
</p>
<p>
  For ceiling smoke, set the control floor at the smoke level, and
  the control ceiling at ceiling level.  Set the control sector darker than
  the target sector light level.
</p>
<p>
  The control sector lighting and colormap are used in the area between the control
  sector ceiling and floor in every tagged sector.
  Within the fog area, all objects and walls will be lighted by the fog light level, and
  all textures that are seen through the fog, will be tinted by the colormap and transluceny
  of the fog.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The control sector light level controls the light level of the fog area.
  If the control sector light is darker than the target sector, it appears like a black fog
(tinted other colors for other colormaps).
   If the control sector light is brighter than the target sector, then the fog
  will appear to be a light source, and will brighten textures and objects within it, leaving
  a bright stripe along the wall.
Suggested light levels for the control sector are 40 to 110.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, RENDERALL, FOG,  BOTHPLANES, INVERTPLANES, ALLSIDES, INVERTSIDES,
  DOUBLESHADOW, EXTRA, CUTEXTRA, CUTSPRITES <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>303 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy 3D ceiling light in tagged<br>
<p>
  Creates a 3D light below the control sector's ceiling height, in all tagged sectors.<br>
  Does the 3D light and colormap of a 3D floor, without the floor.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, CUTSPRITES <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>305 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy 3D double light effect in tagged <br>
<p>
  Creates a 3D light similar to 303, except that the light is only affects the area
between the control sector ceiling height, and the control sector floor height.
  Does the 3D light and colormap of a 3D floor, without the floor.
</p>
<p>
  The control sector light and colormap are used withing the control sector floor and ceiling heights.
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, DOUBLESHADOW, CUTSPRITES <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>306 - LEGACY</strong>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Legacy Invisible floor in tagged <br>
<p>
  Creates a 3D invisible floor, or slab in each tagged sector.
  The floor can be walked on, and will stop weapons, but does not affect
  light nor colormaps.<br>
</p>
3D effects: EXISTS, SOLID <br>
